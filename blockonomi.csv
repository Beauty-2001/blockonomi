Morgan intervened to prevent the banks from bleeding out. Then, in 2008, policymakers stepped in to avert a total collapse of the banking system. Now, there seems to be a similar market dynamic in play.

But it is misleading to talk about those specific events as they were the analogies of historical moments. Because this time, many believe that digital currencies will write their history.

Throughout the months of March and April, three major US banks erupted, followed by investor panics and a potential recession. After the Fed’s interest decision surfaced with a 0.25% rate hike, news of regional banks on the brink has generated headlines.

While the Federal Reserve (Fed) and President Biden keep reassuring that the banking system is sound and resilient, but reality challenges their statements.

More Blood in The Water

Over 24 hours after the FOMC meeting, PacWest Bank ($PACW) and Western Alliance Bank ($WAL) have reportedly sought potential sales.

First Horizon Bank ($FHN) has canceled its merger with TD Bank citing regulatory concerns. Shares of banks have taken a nosedive – $PACW dropped over 50% while $WAL and $FHN fell 53% and 40%, respectively.

J.P. Morgan and other Wall Street powerhouses stepped in to stop the FRB’s financial meltdown.

A $30B bailout package was deposited to the bank from JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BNY Mellon, PNC Bank, and State Street Corp.

Cryptocurrency or CBDCs?

A couple of scenarios are put onto the scene in the event of banking contagion leading to the failure of banks and economic depression. The major highlight, seemingly close to reality, is the potential rollout of a CBDC.

The US is reportedly exploring and developing the infrastructure of a digital dollar.

Last year, US President Joe Biden issued an executive order for the federal government to study the possibility of creating a central bank digital dollar. There is no official confirmation of any plans to launch a CBDC in the near future.

But the concept of a digital dollar is not in many regulators’ best interest. In his latest statement, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said he would ban any CBDC in Florida if the US government issues one.

During a recent speech at a law signing event, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis expressed his opposition to the US government’s possible issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). He warned that CBDCs threaten people’s financial privacy and could be used to block cryptocurrency.

DeSantis claimed that a CBDC would enable the imposition of ESG and social credit scores, significantly reducing people’s freedom in the US. He also stated that the US government’s motivation for issuing a CBDC is to make it the sole currency and eliminate the use of cryptocurrency, which they cannot control.

In line with his beliefs, DeSantis pledged to pass legislation prohibiting the use of CBDCs as money in Florida if the US government ever issued them. He argued that this move would ensure people’s financial independence and prevent the creation of a financial surveillance state where every transaction is monitored.

Cryptos Look Strong in Weak Market

Despite the recent turmoil in the banking industry, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and altcoins have continued to gain in popularity and adoption.
In fact, during the banking panics, the price of Bitcoin and other digital assets remained less unstable, while traditional banking stocks took significant dips.

Whether cryptocurrency or CBDCs can fix the current financial system remains controversial. While some argue that Bitcoin provides a decentralized and transparent alternative to traditional banking, others point to its volatility and lack of regulation as significant concerns.

On the other hand, a CBDC offers the potential for greater financial inclusion and efficiency, but its biggest flaw is centralizing the control of the monetary system in the hands of governments.","https://blockonomi.com/banks-fail-crypto-prevails-cbdcs-in-play/"

"AngelBlock: Non Custodial Fundraising Platform for Crypto","The web3 space is growing, and AngelBlock is making fundraising happen for web3 startups that need access to capital. As…","The web3 space is growing, and AngelBlock is making fundraising happen for web3 startups that need access to capital. As a totally decentralized solution to funding, AngelBlock makes token-based fundraising simple and transparent.

With the system that AngelBlock has created, startups will have easy access to funding with budgetary plans, and release timelines for the capital they raise based on token sales. AngelBlock has also utilized other important features like on-chain vesting, as well as a voting system for investors.

In many ways, web3 companies are working in a web2 funding and investment environment. Without taking advantage of all the technical innovation that modern decentralized solutions offer, web3 start-ups are put at a disadvantage. AngelBlock addresses these challenges, and offers start-ups a lot more.

AngelBlock Creates Web3 Funding Solutions

Contents [Show]

The web3 fundraising space looks a lot like the wild west at the moment. While blockchain does provide some transparency, rug-pulls are frequent, and in many cases, investors are left with worthless tokens. If a web3 startup chooses to go the established fundraising route with VC companies, the business model has to change, and they may not be able to grow efficiently.

Early-stage investment should help both the start-up company, and the investors. AngelBlock’s non-custodial, protocol-based platform is a great way forward for fundraising in the web3 space, as it creates an environment that protects investors, while rewarding start-ups that deliver on their development goals.

The core of AngelBlock’s platform uses smart-contracts to protect investors, while making sure that start-ups know that the money they need will be there for them. The end result is a platform that makes fundraising work for web3, and empowers both investors and early-stage companies with a trustless and transparent investment environment.

A New Way Forward for Web3

AngelBlock uses innovative tools to make sure that both web3 projects and investors get what they need from investments and capital. The development process should be as transparent as possible, especially when the web3 space has so much to offer investors.

Here are some of the unique advantages that the AngelBlock platform offers:

Automated token vesting and distribution system

Did you know that around 20% of the tokens from fundraising are sent to the wrong addresses because of manual errors?

It is true. AngelBlock has an on-chain vesting system that makes sure that investors get the token investments they pay for, and that the smart-contacts used deliver the correct tokens, in the correct amounts, to the right investors.

Getting the token distribution right might seem like a simple thing, and AngelBlock is making sure that it is as simple as it gets!

Milestone-based payout approach with embedded governance mechanisms

Much like the world of Venture Capital (VC) investment, AngelBlock created a milestone-based value distribution system. When the fundraising process begins, a start-up must define a series of milestones that it will achieve on the way to the product launch.

Investors are empowered with this system, as they are able to vote on the distribution of funds, and the start-ups will only get the tokens when the milestones are reached. The investment community is empowered with this system, and start-ups are assured that if milestones are met – the funding they need will be available.

Aligning stakeholders’ interests with the Tholos token

Like most web3 projects, AngelBlock has its own token, called $THOL. It exists to incentivize everyone in the AngelBlock ecosystem, so that the community, start-ups, and investors are in total alignment. Validators and active participants are rewarded, and any participating investor or web3 project is rewarded.

Decentralizing governance with the AngelBlock DAO

AngelBlock is working to create long term value in the web3 ecosystem, and hopes to launch a DAO. The AngelBlock DAO would exist to give the wider community a voice in how the overall platform works, and ensure that the goals of transparency and accountability are always followed in practice.

Commitment to compliance and security

AngelBlock is dedicated to making sure that web3 fundraising is as transparent and secure as possible, so it puts KYC/AML standards in a prime position. It follows global standards created by the Financial Action Task Force, and the EU 2015/849 Directive. AngelBlock is also working with the new EU MiCA framework, so it stays ahead of the regulatory curve.

AngelBlock Adds Value

The biggest value added by AngelBlock is a safe fundraising environment for web3 projects. Without safety for investors, raising capital is difficult. In addition to safety, AngelBlock is totally decentralized, and gives both projects and investors 100% transparency at every stage of the fundraising and development process.

A decentralized process is a benefit to everyone in the web3 fundraising ecosystem. In some ways current web3 fundraising infrastructure acts like a CEX, or centralized exchange. The project is given all of the funding it needs, and investors have little recourse in the case of a problem, or even worse, a rug-pull.

In fact, AngelBlock could be the new model for fundraising in the world of web3. Investors need to have transparency, and with the safeguards that AngelBlock puts in place, both start-ups and investors are much safer when compared to the current model. With the platform that AngelBlock designed, the need for trust in the fundraising ecosystem is removed, and everyone wins.

Safety and Secure Investments

Let’s face it, the current web3 fundraising economy is risky. One of the near-term goals that AngelBlock has is to change this challenging dynamic, and create industry-wide standards for web3 fundraising. The goal is to have a global standard for web3 fundraising, which makes the ecosystem more efferent for everyone.

Who Would Benefit From AngelBlock?

With the web3 space growing quickly, there are a number of sectors that benefit from the platform that AngelBlock is developing. Ultimately, the entire web3 economy benefits from efficiency, but the end user may never fully understand the importance of an efferent early-stage funding economy.

Investors and web3 start-ups, on the other hand, are the clear beneficiaries of AngelBlock, both in terms of the features it offers, and the fact that investors will look to projects on AngelBlock as a safer way to enter early-stage web3 companies.

AngelBlock is also developing a grant program that has already awarded the equivalent of $90,000, and the company is planning on continuing to offer rewards to promising early-stage start-ups.

Wider Access for Smaller Investors

One of the most important aspects of AngelBlock is the fact that it allows smaller investors to enter an investment space that has traditionally been dominated by VC funds, or ever larger investors. With AngelBlock, much smaller investors are able to enter the web3 start-up investment arena, and with AngelBlock, smaller investors gain the same protections that traditional VC investors have.

While access to small companies is great for small investors, it is also a big win for the start-ups. Instead of being forced to deal with a few major tech VC groups that can dictate the terms of an investment, now, start-ups can deal with a much wider range of smaller investors.

AngelBlock Makes Sense For The Web3 Economy

With a highly experienced team, and a solid design behind the platform, AngelBlock is delivering real value to the web3 development ecosystem. It allows investors to enter early-stage web3 companies with confidence, and also gives the same start-ups access to new streams of liquidity on favorable terms.

"Patientory Platform: Your Health Is Your Wealth","In the past, healthcare was one of the sectors that was slow to adopt new technology. However, like many other…","In the past, healthcare was one of the sectors that was slow to adopt new technology. However, like many other sectors, healthcare is about to undergo a period of rapid transformation after the increase of coronavirus.

Launched in 2015 by the Founder and CEO Chrissa McFarlane, Patientory is a blockchain-based, HIPAA-compliant software platform that gathers and analyzes healthcare data to empower people with actionable data-driven insights for improved health outcomes and well-being.

The purpose of Patientory is to securely facilitate and encrypt the transmission of health data while empowering healthcare professionals and patients in storing healthcare data and the ability to monetize that secure data.

Unlike other data, medical data can tell a bad actor a lot about a person because of its highly sensitive nature.

Not only that, but it’s also one of the most lagging sectors in cybersecurity. Without a doubt, health data is very valuable and sensitive information of an individual can be stolen and used on the dark web in many ways.

All of these challenges can be addressed, and Patientory has some new ideas that can help!

What Is Patientory?

Contents [Show]

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of digital technologies. Healthcare providers and patients have found new and innovative, socially-distanced ways to deliver and receive services by adopting and shifting toward better technologies like blockchain technology, AI, and machine learning to provide better care.

In the flow of these changes, Patientory is one of the most innovative healthcare projects that have been introduced in the past.

The Founder and CEO of Patientory has been also recognized as one of the top women in the health IT field. In addition to being a Digital Health influencer for HIMSS, an ambassador for the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, and an advisor to several MedTech companies, she is also an author with her first book published in 2019.

Upload Your Medical Records

As one of the first companies to adopt blockchain technology in the healthcare industry, its products are built on the PTOYMatrix network, a HIPAA-compliant blockchain-enabled Health Information Exchange & Storage network, administered by the Patientory Association, which stores and exchanges health data in a secure and encrypted way.

The Patientory Association is a global nonprofit healthcare member organization that supports emerging technologies in the healthcare industry and connects users of the PTOYMatrix network, which securely stores and manages health information in real-time. Also, such storage and management are facilitated by a blockchain-based token.

As a result, Patientory empowers patients, medical professionals, and healthcare organizations to securely access, store, and exchange health information in real-time with the highest levels of security.

The personal health score is Patientory’s key metric.

Each patient will be evaluated based on their current health condition and their lifestyle to generate their health score which is improved over time as the patient follows the recommended care plan. Patientory recruits for clinical trials, therefore, the platform’s solutions can be used for clinical trial management.

To date, Patientory has gained 45,000+ subscribers and strategic partnerships. Furthermore, it can integrate into the major EHR systems, including Epic, Cerner, Allscripts, Meditech, and Athenahealth.

What Patientory Offers

The blockchain healthcare platform has two main solutions. As such, there’s a platform for enterprises and the rest is an app for consumers.

As said, both products take advantage of the blockchain network to grant individuals with their health data and enterprises a secure platform for risk as well as predictive modeling for population health management.

The Patientory Mobile App

This is a mobile, blockchain-powered, decentralized application in which patients and users are able to access their health information conveniently and securely.

Health data, like patients’ hospital records, lab results, a wearable device, and genomic data, among other personal health data across multiple care teams and facilities, is complied in the mobile dApp, so that there will be a unified and comprehensive wellness profile of the patient’s entire history is created in Patientory.

You can download the app from Android or IOS stores and easily integrate the Patientory app with popular mobile apps and wearables to showcase their vitals in a uniform dashboard.

Patientory dApp
Neith – Enterprise Software Tool

On the other hand, Neith is a disease-agnostic, HIPAA-compliant, big data analytics platform providing health management solutions for enterprise customers.

The platform is able to integrate seamlessly with the consumer-facing mobile dApp Patientory in order to help integrate lifestyle data into care plans, streamline value-based care initiatives, and provide risk-mitigating analytics for enterprises and their patients.

Tokenomics

Patientory uses blockchain and the ability to securely monetize this information. $PTOY is a native cryptocurrency in the PTOYMatrix network.

The PTOYMatrix, Patientory’s own private blockchain network ensures patient healthcare data is cryptographically protected. The network will remain stored in a secure and decentralized manner with storage access managed by $PTOY traded on exchanges.

Storing data in the PTOYMatrix network can improve data integrity and reduce transactional and operational costs. This also helps to remove third party intermediaries in managing healthcare data.

As such, users can purchase or exchange the native token on the PTOY website or onon popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bittrex, SwapZone, or CoinSwitch.

The key features of $PTOY are as follows:

IN-APP PURCHASES: You can use the token to participate in token use cases or buy additional storage on applications that use the PTOYMatrix.
DAPP DEVELOPERS: Allowing developers to seamlessly integrate other their existing healthcare technology software or build solutions as DApps on the PTOYMatrix system.
STORAGE NODE HOSTS: By joining as a participant on the PTOYMatrix blockchain network, users can also earn $PTOY for unused storage space.
SMART CONTRACTS: Allowing the Execution of Smart Contracts for the healthcare ecosystem.
What Makes Patientory Outstanding

Patientory is a pioneer in the adoption of blockchain technology in healthcare in the midst that the existing healthcare system is being pushed towards more digitization and technology.

As said, Patientory is one of three HIPAA-compliant platforms adopting blockchain, big data, and machine intelligence to enable enterprises to understand consumer health data.

It is the only company to offer on-chain healthcare population analytics, on top of a specific healthcare blockchain, and has been able to achieve this with a fraction of the funding received by its competitors.

Also, the platform’s increased interoperability improves care coordination while ensuring data security, minimizing health breaches with an 85% decrease in hospital readmissions and penalties and yielding a 42% decrease in IT expenditures.

In addition, emerging AI tools such as ChatGPT could likely add tremendous value to the medical field, but absorbing all of that sensitive information without violating HIPAA on the output side can’t be done casually.

Meanwhile, Patientory’s design also contains AI services to provide better insight as well as for a secure database ready to pair with advanced tools like ChatGPT.

New Ideas for Healthcare

After all, with a growing demand for healthcare population health management solutions that incorporate cybersecurity, Patientory takes advantage of Blockchain and AI technology for accurate patient treatment to create a safer way for patients and providers to share data in the future.

Patientory is empowering users globally with actionable insights into their health and medical data through its secure decentralized blockchain network. Therefore, Patientory is a necessary solution for both patients and providers to improve health outcomes.

"Banking Turmoil Fears Heighten as FED Hikes Interest Rate by 0.25%","Financial markets have seen volatility following Wednesday’s FOMC meeting. But the biggest threat is ahead – and cryptos won’t be…","Financial markets have seen volatility following Wednesday’s FOMC meeting. But the biggest threat is ahead – and cryptos won’t be spared.

Tipping Point

Contents [Show]

The federal funds rate currently sits at 5%-5.25%. This range resulted from the Fed’s decision to increase the interest rate by 25 basis points during the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) on May 3.

Prior to the announcement, the markets had widely anticipated that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) – the Fed’s governing body responsible for setting monetary policy – would approve a 0.25 percentage point increase in interest rates, marking the 10th rate hike since March 2022 and bringing the US operating interest rate to 5-5.25%.

While the rate hike was expected, the Fed omitted language that had previously signaled more hikes in the future, indicating a potential pause in rate increases. However, a break is far from cutting the rate, given that inflation data remains above 2%.

Inflation persists at high levels, with the consumer price index displaying a 5% increase for the 12 months ending in March, albeit slightly lower than February’s 6%. The Federal Reserve aims to bring inflation back to its 2% target rate, the fed funds target rate.

A Dicey Move

The Fed’s move comes amid mounting fears over banking contagion in recent months. In March, Silicon Valley Bank’s bank run sent shockwaves to the financial markets. SVB was closely associated with Silicon fintech startups, which sustained the losses from interest rate hikes.

Following SVB, the crypto-friendly bank Silvergate announced its closure, with US regulators quickly coming to the rescue. Despite multiple efforts to ensure the well-handling of the banking system, the banking crisis has withstood the test of time. By the end of March, First Republic Bank became the third major bank to fall.

And today, PacWest Bankcorp $PACW crashed over 55% in after-hours trading. Speculations regarding a potential collapse are rife after Bloomberg reported the bank was looking for sale. Experts warn that the banking system likely faces extreme turbulence in the coming time under rate hike pressure.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the Fed would be ‘ready to do more’ if economic activity warrants it. They will examine incoming data on a meeting-by-meeting basis to determine future policy actions.

The Fed chairman also noted that ‘the banking system is sound and resilient. Powell pointed out that a soft landing for the economy is likely, meaning a drop in inflation without a recession or economic crisis.

Market Fluctuates

The crypto market was volatile shortly after the Fed’s news, with Bitcoin and altcoins dropping slightly. But bullish momentum has returned, as Bitcoin trading volume increased to $19 billion, and the market capitalization remained stable at $562 billion, according to CoinMarketCap today.

However, there were notable fluctuations in the market prices of other virtual currencies, with several cryptocurrencies dropping simultaneously. In the past 24 hours, Render Token saw the highest increase of 11.12%, while Sui experienced the highest discount, down 67.80% in the last 24 hours.

Although the crypto market is expected to have little response to the rate hike, Bitcoin has outperformed the stock market on seven of the previous ten Fed days, according to Callie Cox, a US investment analyst at eToro.

Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, believes that macroeconomic events are driving Bitcoin’s performance this year, and the bullish guidance from the Fed on a pause in rate hikes could push BTC to slightly higher levels, around 29k-30k.

The future reaction of the crypto market to macroeconomic events and regulatory changes is an open question as the industry continues to progress and transform.

For investors, uncertainty remains about whether the US central bank has reached the end of its rate hike cycle or will continue tightening to manage inflation.","https://blockonomi.com/banking-turmoil-fears-heighten-as-fed-hikes-interest-rate-by-0-25/"

Coinbase, one of the leading exchanges in the US, has just introduced its new international exchange – Coinbase International Exchange.

The exchange allows institutional users outside the US to trade perpetual futures in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with 5x leverage, settled in USDC.

The move came amid intense scrutiny by regulators in the US.

On the other hand, other markets have increasingly adopted regulatory frameworks to become crypto hubs. This creates a ripe opportunity for Coinbase to expand its services and bring the benefits of crypto to a global audience.

Everyone is Moving Offshore

Contents [Show]

The new exchange will offer high liquidity markets, dynamic margin requirements, and a robust risk management framework to protect customers, according to Coinbase’s official announcement on the website.

News regarding Coinbase’s establishment of a derivatives exchange has been disclosed since April when the US-based cryptocurrency firm registered to form a subsidiary in Bermuda.

The recent approval of its regulatory license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) allows Coinbase to build a global perpetual futures exchange for digital assets that is safe, secure, and transparent. Previously, the crypto exchange solely focused on the US market.

While it is good news for global future trading, the platform is not open to all users. As Coinbase stated, only users who meet the exchange’s requirements can apply to open an account on Coinbase International Exchange.

The SEC is on The Warpath

Coinbase International Exchange offers real-time 24/7 – 365 risk management support, with liquidity provided by external market makers with no proprietary trading connection with Coinbase.

The platform also provides dynamic margin requirements, collateral assessments, and a liquidation mechanism that meets rigorous compliance standards. Coinbase International Exchange is well-capitalized to support tail market events and prevent market fluctuations.

While the exchange is not available to retail customers now, it offers a fantastic opportunity for institutional investors outside of the US to leverage Coinbase’s high customer protection and trading technology standards to achieve their investment goals.

Foster Innovation, Challenge Regulation

In a recent announcement, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, disclosed that the company is considering withdrawing from the US market due to the country’s challenging regulatory landscape.

Speaking at the Fintech London week, Armstrong stated that if the regulatory environment in the US does not improve, the exchange will assess the possibility of a pullback from the market.

This is not the first time Armstrong has voiced his concerns about crypto legislation in the US. In November last year, he argued that the lack of clear regulation from the SEC has caused many US investors to move abroad.

As more countries move forward with responsible crypto-forward regulatory frameworks, the economic powerhouse is expected to follow suit to avoid regulation by enforcement. Coinbase is committed to the US, but the status quo becomes challenging.

In recent years, instead of developing a transparent framework, the US regulators’ approach has been considered overreaching, targeting individuals and organizations in the industry.

The US Securities and Exchange (SEC) has notified Coinbase itself that it is not clear of wrongdoing. In response, the exchange sued the SEC for not providing clear instructions despite being asked many times.

The crypto industry is grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny from the US government.

With the SEC and other agencies cracking down on crypto companies and investors, many in the industry feel pressure. Meanwhile, countries worldwide are increasingly positioning themselves as crypto hubs, and the company wants to bring its trusted name to the global market.

Whether Coinbase will follow through on its threat to withdraw from the US market remains to be seen, but the announcement has undoubtedly added to the growing debate around crypto regulation in the country.","https://blockonomi.com/coinbase-opens-doors-to-global-crypto-trading-with-new-international-exchange/"
"Crypto Market Volatility Persists Ahead of Fed Rate Announcement","The crypto market is under pressure as the Fed rate decision draws near. All eyes are set on the FOMC…","The crypto market is under pressure as the Fed rate decision draws near. All eyes are set on the FOMC meeting this week as the Fed faces a tough decision – whether to raise or to let inflation run wild.

The US banking crisis has intensified following the recent collapse of First Republic Bank. This ongoing turbulence started in March when Silvergate Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank failed due to their significant exposure to the cryptocurrency market, which was experiencing instability then.

US regulators promptly intervened by seizing the banks to regain control. However, the domino effect of the banking crisis in the US hasn’t stopped.

By the end of April, First Republic Bank (FRB) became the third major bank to fail. In March, the top banks in America, including JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Truist, agreed to offer FRB a $30 billion rescue deal.

Still, it was not enough to keep it afloat.

Fed Faces Tough Decision

With concerns mounting regarding the non-stop banking turmoil, Fed’s decision this week is the mainstream headline. Another rate likely officializes the economic recession, just like previous interest hikes sent shockwaves throughout the banking sector.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the collapse of SVB and SB has almost disrupted the equilibrium of the US economy, which is fragile under high-interest rates.

Given the persistent inflation exceeding the Federal Reserve’s targeted 2% and the unemployment rate remaining at record lows, financial experts believe Fed would undertake another quarter-point increment to its benchmark interest rate in the forthcoming Wednesday meeting.

The measure would elevate the federal funds rate to its peak since 2006.

However, the probability of the central bankers indicating a plan to further increase interest rates at their June meeting or maintaining flexibility in their approach remains uncertain.

According to Nicolas Colas, the founder of DataTrek Research, it is highly likely that Fed will increase the interest rate by 0.25 basis points to 5.00-5.25% during the FOMC meeting scheduled on Wednesday.

To wit,

“Wednesday will almost certainly see the FOMC raise Fed funds by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.00 – 5.25 percent.”

The markets will be closely monitoring the press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell for insights into future decisions. If the rate-hiking cycle ends this week, Colas anticipates that Powell will mention it during the post-meeting press conference.

The markets expect confirmation of this development, and Powell’s framing of his thoughts on the need for further rate hikes could be pivotal, given his close monitoring of Fed Funds Futures.

According to CME data, futures markets have an 89% probability of a 25 basis point hike, but there is less certainty about future actions. While some analysts predict a pause in hikes, others anticipate potential rate cuts.

Dalvir Mandara, a quantitative researcher at MacroHive, agrees with the market’s projection of a 90% chance of a 25 bp hike at the May 3 FOMC. However, Mandara disagrees with the forecast of 60 basis points of rate cuts for the remainder of 2023.

Crypto Market Volatility

This is an important week for the crypto market, as the prices of Bitcoin and altcoins are declining in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s meeting.

Despite reaching a high of $29,975 on Sunday, Bitcoin experienced a drop to $28,500 due to selling pressure. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin has experienced four consecutive months of growth.

Aside from the Federal Reserve meeting, other significant economic events are taking place this week, and there are ongoing issues with the First Bank of the Republic.

Mandara noted that Bitcoin is currently in a “corrective zone,” with the largest cryptocurrency trading at around $27,800.

If the head of the Federal Reserve says something that traders don’t like, Bitcoin’s price could decrease even further, potentially dipping below the weekly support level of $25,400.","https://blockonomi.com/crypto-market-volatility-persists-ahead-of-fed-rate-announcement/"

The new offering, Mastercard Crypto Credential, aims to set verification standards and offer the necessary technology for various use cases across the sector.

In a blog post on the company’s website, Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard’s head of crypto and blockchain, explained the reason behind the effort, saying that they need a way to ensure interactions on public blockchain networks are trustworthy, compliant, and verifiable to fully implement rules and build scalable use cases.

Mastercard Moves Further Into Crypto

Mastercard also outlined the significant difference between levels of authentication across crypto products, for example, NFT and crypto wallets, calling for the need to create a new offering.

Mastercard Crypto Credential would provide straightforward aliases to assist consumers in more easily sharing wallet addresses and use metadata to define wallet attributes to ensure only intended transactions are completed.

CipherTrace, a crypto intelligence firm that Mastercard acquired in 2021, will help verify addresses and support compliance with cross-border transaction regulations. Aptos Labs, Ava Labs, Polygon, and the Solana Foundation will help bring Mastercard’s new offering to application developers.

Six fintech companies were also added to Mastercard’s Start Path Digital Assets program, designed to provide startups with access to the payment giant’s channels and customers and technical collaboration.

Ramp Up In Web3 Innovation

Mastercard has long emerged in crypto, especially in Web3 and NFT. Earlier in 2022, the company announced its strategic partnership with Coinbase to enable NFT purchases on the Coinbase NFT marketplace with a Mastercard.

The payment giant has also advanced its foray into non-fungible tokens and developing web mechanisms through partnerships with several prominent NFT marketplaces, including Immutable X, Candy Digital, The Sandbox Mintable, Spring, Nifty Gateway, and the web3 infrastructure provider MoonPay.

The goal of Mastercard, through those partnerships, is to elevate its presence in the Web3 space and allow more users to buy NFTs directly from their payment cards instead of having to purchase cryptocurrency first.

Blockchain technology remains the company’s focus, and Mastercard aims to apply that technology to help solve today’s complex problems and build efficient systems.

Mastercard is one of many major payment companies that expressed interest in the sector. Over the past few years, numerous companies have begun to explore ways to integrate cryptocurrencies into their offerings as they see it as the next big thing in finance.

Massive Future in Payments

Payment card companies have announced numerous partnerships with crypto companies and established dedicated groups to explore the underlying technology.

However, recent turmoil in the space forced a slow down. The regulatory environment in the US created a significant barrier. Typically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been repeatedly targeting the crypto industry since the beginning of this year.

Visa and Mastercard have announced their plans to delay the launch of new partnerships with crypto firms. This decision follows a period of instability in the crypto industry, with major players such as FTX and BlockFi seeking bankruptcy protection.

These events have led to investor anxiety and increased regulatory scrutiny over the sector.

In light of these circumstances, both Visa and Mastercard have decided to defer the introduction of specific crypto-related products and services until market conditions and regulatory environment improve.

It is a significant setback for the crypto industry, which has been seeking mainstream adoption from traditional financial institutions.

Despite the setbacks, the crypto industry remains optimistic about its long-term prospects.

As more investors recognize the value of decentralized systems and blockchain technology, the industry is expected to grow in the coming years. Mastercard is taking a proactive approach to ensure the industry’s long-term success and pave the way for mainstream adoption.","https://blockonomi.com/mastercard-ramps-up-efforts-in-blockchain-space/"

Contents [Show]

The platform offers an optimised and intuitive interface for both beginners and seasoned traders.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this free trial to understand how the platform works before you opt-in for a paid version.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

Another major plus is the wealth of resources made available on the platform, and the Support Section contains a number of guides, and FAQs that help people get to grips with the most important issues.

Furthermore, the team maintain a blog that details a number of key concepts for newer traders, and also provide further assistance via their Telegram group, YouTube Channel, and other social media channels, and members can gain access to the 3Commas Discord from inside their accounts.

XM Overview


The broker offers an advanced trading platform as well as flexible trading conditions to accommodate a range of global clients. XM’s expertise comes from in-depth knowledge of and experience with the global financial markets.

The broker is dedicated to offering superior services. Those include trading currencies, CFDs, precious metals, energies, and equity indices.

XM also offers its operational philosophy as a reason to consider choosing this company as a broker. Its philosophy is to earn loyalty as a way to ensure the satisfaction of clients. XM recognizes that credibility and reputation are closely linked.

XM also takes steps to adapt to changing client needs as they become more demanding and sophisticated. This is done by monitoring industry trends and technologies. XM is proud to have never compromised on factors impacting client performance. This directly leads to the broker’s ability to deliver the best execution and tight spreads.

One of the important characteristics of XM is the company’s strive to remain human and connect with clients. This is why management has visited more than 120 cities worldwide to meet with clients as well as partners. XM feels that human interactions have a high value and always aims to deliver those interactions.

XM strives to offer a range of learning opportunities for traders of all skill levels. Part of this is hosting seminars around the world. The goal is to give traders the skills needed to make improved trading decisions. XM has already hosted hundreds of these seminars, with even more planned.

The XM Foundation

XM also runs the XM Foundation. This foundation focuses on creating equal opportunities via humanitarian action. The mission of the XM Foundation is making a positive difference to people and assist them with achieving their potential. This goal applies regardless of religion, ethnic background, and culture.

The XM Foundation assists with development and access to vocational skills and education via initiating projects. It also provides international aid by working with international and local human aid foundations that are active.

The XM Foundation page on the XM broker’s website includes recent news and initiatives from the foundation. These include specific donations made and the goals of those donations.

What Types of Accounts Does XM Offer?

XM lets clients choose from four main types of accounts: Micro, Standard, XM Ultra Low, and Shares Accounts. All account types have exceptional trading conditions and unlimited access to MT4/MT4 with EA trading.

XM also offers the ability to trade standard or micro lots, and the same execution quality across account types. There are free and regular intra-day market updates plus technical analysis. There is also multilingual customer support plus Personal Account Managers.

Micro and Standard Accounts

Micro Accounts can have the base currency of USD, GBP, EUR, CHF, JPY, AUD, PLN, HUF, RUB, ZAR, or SGD. 1 lot is 1,000 and there are no commissions. This type of account has negative balance protection, trading bonuses, and no deposit bonuses.

An Islamic account is optional and the minimum deposit is $5. Hedging is allowed. Trading on MT4 must meet the trade volume minimum of 0.01 lots, which is 0.1 lots on MT5. These clients can only have up to 200 positions open or pending at a time. There is a limit of 100 lots per ticket.

The main difference for Standard Accounts with XM is that 1 lot is 100,000. There is a restriction of 50 lots per ticket and the minimum trade volume is 0.01 lots. Other than this, the Standard and Micro Accounts are essentially identical.

XM Ultra Low Account

An XM Ultra Low Account is available with the base currency of USD, GBP, EUR, SGD, AUD, or ZAD. You still have no commissions and negative balance protection. Islamic Accounts remain optional. There are no trading bonuses and no deposit bonuses, plus hedging is allowed.

The minimum deposit is $50. There is still a maximum of 200 open or pending positions.
XM Ultra Low Accounts can be Standard Ultra or Micro Ultra.
For Standard Ultra, minimum trade volume is 0.01 lots and there is a limit of 50 lots per ticket.
For Micro Ultra, these figures are 0.1 lots and 100 lots, respectively.
What Other Accounts Does XM Offer?

Shares Accounts are always Islamic and have a minimum deposit of $10,000. There are no trading bonuses, no deposit bonuses, and hedging is not allowed.

The contract size is 1 share with a minimum trade volume of 1 lot. Clients can have a maximum of 50 positions open and pending, and the lot restriction per ticket depends on the share.

XM can also help clients create custom-tailored accounts for trading forex. This allows flexibility to meet the needs of any client.

Islamic Accounts

As previously mentioned, most of the account types available on XM are offered as Islamic accounts. Islamic or swap-free accounts do not have any rollover or swap interest for overnight positions.

To open an Islamic account, simply open an account normally and then validate it in the Member’s Area. At this point, you just contact XM to change it to an Islamic Account. Keep in mind that XM does reserve the ability to revoke the swap-free status in case of abuse.

Compared to other forex brokers who offer Islamic accounts, XM’s offerings stand out. That is because most brokers will give Islamic accounts higher spreads. XM, however, does not apply additional charges on Islamic Accounts.

Additionally, XM remains respectful to the idea of Islamic Accounts, never using “swap-free in disguise” accounts. Some brokers use this type of account, in which they transfer the interest charge to a different fee. As this would still be a charge covering interest, it goes against ethical and fair trading.

What Assets Can You Trade With XM?

XM gives clients the ability to trade more than 1,000 instruments across seven asset classes. These include forex, individual stocks, precious metals, commodities, cryptocurrencies, energies, and equity indices.

You can view all the specific instruments available for trading on the individual asset pages.

There are 57 forex pairs available, including majors, minors, and exotics.
There are 1,210 stock CFDs. You can browse or search them, including by country.
The stock CFDs span 17 countries.
Those include the USA, the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Austria, Australia, and Russia.

XM offers access to eight commodities via futures CFDs. There is access to 18 cash indices CFDs and 12 futures indices CFDs. XM also lets clients trade two spot metals instruments, gold and silver. Finally, there are five futures CFDs of energies.

What Trading Conditions Does XM Offer?

The specific trading conditions vary based on account type. Leverage for Micro Accounts with trades between $5 and $20,000 is 1:1 to 1:888. For trades between $20,001 and $100,000, it is 1:1 to 1:200. For those at or above $100,001, it is 1:1 to 1:100. This is known as dynamic leverage.

Essentially, the margin percentage will increase as the volume per trade increases. The spreads on Micro Accounts can be as low as 1 pip. There are no commissions. This information is identical for Standard Accounts.

For XM Ultra Low Accounts, the leverage is identical, but spreads can be as low as 0.6 pips. There are no commissions. There is no leverage on Shares Accounts and the spread is per the underlying exchange. There is a commission with this type of account.

You can view all trading conditions for each specific asset by visiting the asset class’s page. There, you will find minimum price fluctuations, starting point for spreads, swap values, average spreads, and value of a lot.

The information provided varies by asset class and can also include min and max trade size and margin percentage. All of this information is divided by account type, so you know where you stand for each specific asset.

XM Spreads

It is important to note that XM uses variable spreads, as does the interbank forex market. By offering variable spreads, XM is able to eliminate the need for an insurance premium. That would be necessary for fixed spreads since they tend to be higher than the variable spreads.

This is further hampered by the fact that many brokers restrict trading close to news announcements. As such, the required insurance premium becomes worthless.

By offering variable spreads, XM is able to avoid these issues for traders. There are also no restrictions related to trading at the time of news releases.

XM also gives clients access to fractional pip pricing. This allows for the best prices from the XM liquidity providers.

Essentially, a 5th digit can be added to the typical 4-digit price quotes. This lets clients take advantage of even tiny price movements. It also allows for the most accurate quoting and tighter spreads.

XM Leverage and Margins

Essentially, clients with XM are typically able to select leverage between 1:1 and 888:1. This depends on the account type, asset, and trade size. The margin requirements remain the same 24/7, including on weekends and overnight. XM also allows you to request a change to your selected leverage, either a decrease or an increase.

XM cautions traders that trading with leverage carries a risk. It does, however, also increase the potential rewards from trading. To help clients manage real-time risk exposure, XM offers the ability to monitor your margin.

You can monitor both the free and used margin, which combine as the equity. The used margin is how much money you must deposit for holding a trade. Free margin refers to the quantity still in your trading account. This will fluctuate based on account equity. You can use it to absorb losses or open additional positions.

XM also has a margin call policy that ensures the maximum possible risk never exceeds the account equity. If your account equity dips under 50 percent of your required margin for open positions, XM sends a margin call warning.

This is a notification that your account lacks sufficient equity for supporting the open positions. For those who typically engage in telephone trading, the dealers may give a margin call. This is essentially advisement to either deposit funds or close positions.

For further fund protection, XM also has a stop-out level. This is the equity level that causes your open positions to automatically close. Retail clients with Standard, Micro, or XM Ultra Low Accounts have a stop-out level of 20 percent.

What Should You Know About Overnight Positions With XM?

For overnight positions, XM prides itself on offering competitive and transparent swap rates. The rollover policy is that XM will credit or debit client accounts and take care of rollover interest.

This applies to any position held open following 22:00 GMT. It is important to note that rollovers do not take place during Saturdays and Sundays since the markets are closed.

Despite this, banks will calculate interest on positions held during the weekend. As such, XM applies 3-day rollover strategies on Wednesday.

How Do You Place an Order With XM?

XM allows you to place a range of order types. These include trailing stops, stops, limits, and market orders. Place the trade at any time of the day, provided that it is during trading hours. There is also the ability to place trades via the telephone for those who prefer this method.

What Are the Trading Hours?

The trading hours on XM are those of the market. For the forex market, one market will close when another opens thanks to markets in New York, Sydney, Tokyo, and London.

This allows for 24/5 trading on the forex market. The XM trading hours are from Sunday at 22:05 GMT to Friday at 21:50 GMT. This applies to phone trading.

If you use the trading platform outside of these hours, trades will not execute. Instead, you can only view the relevant features.

What Is the XM Execution Policy?

With XM, clients can trade with real-time execution and no requotes. Since the policy began in 2010, XM has had no rejection of orders and no requotes at all. 100 percent of orders are executed, with an impressive 99.35 percent executed within a second.

You can place orders on the XM-supported platforms at any time during the trading hours. Positions stay open until your closing trade gets executed. The balance of your account will be updated in real time to reflect the current market prices. Just keep in mind that there is a maximum of 200 positions that can be opened at a time. This includes pending orders and is per client.

XM offers fractional pip pricing that makes it possible to trade using tighter spreads. It also allows for the most accurate quoting possible.

Fills for market orders occur with a simple click. Market orders can be filled with up to 50 lots (or 5 million). Those who want to trade even larger quantities with market orders have two options. You can place the trade by phone or divide the order into several smaller ones.

Fills for limit and stop-loss orders are guaranteed with up to 50 lots. These occur at the market price that is the best available. This policy allows clients to manage their risk.

There is a clear policy for market gaps between Friday close and the Sunday opening. This can include holidays and weekends. XM will execute the pending stop and limit orders at the first market price available for the position size.

Even in cases of illiquidity and volatility, XM has a competitive policy. XM partners with numerous liquidity providers to significantly limit the risk of illiquidity. In volatile market conditions, XM will execute orders at the market price that is the best available.

What Trading Platforms Can You Use With XM?

Clients of XM have access to either MT4 or MT5, both of which are popular MetaTrader platforms. They are available across devices and you can trade via the XM WebTrader in the browser.

Despite the popularity and prevalence of the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms, XM stands out. XM was a pioneer in offering an MT4 platform that focuses on trading execution quality. Trading on MT4 with XM gives you access to leverage between 1:1 and 888:1. There are also no rejections or requotes.

MetaTrader 4

The MetaTrader 4 platform for XM gives you a range of features. There are more than 1,000 instruments available to trade via this platform. With a single login, you can access 8 different platforms.

You still get similar features to other MT4 platforms. MT4 Multiterminal offers three allocation methods, multiple order types, and execution and management in real time.

MetaTrader 5

The other major platform available from XM is MetaTrader 5. MT5 builds on the offerings of MT4, adding 1,000 stocks/shares CFDs. As such, it is a great multi-asset platform.

MT5 is available for PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android, and Android Tablets, or as a WebTrader.

If you are wondering if Uphold is the best option for you to trade crypto, we have you covered.

What Is Uphold?

Contents [Show]

Uphold describes itself as a “global multi-asset digital trading platform”. Founded back in 2015, it has quickly grown to become one of the major destinations for people looking to take charge of their finances by investing their money.

At this time, the platform is used by people located in over 184 countries, supports over 200 currencies, and provides access to a variety of commodities. This reach has allowed Uphold to power more than $31 billion in transactions ever since being launched over 91 million transactions, a testament to its popularity.

With the mission to be the “center of the digital money revolution”, Uphold is all about making investing as easy as possible for its users. This is why it strives to offer a unique experience through its “anything-to-anything” capabilities, simplifying the investment process beyond what other platforms are capable of.

With Uphold, you can set up an account, verify your identity and buy crypto

Combined with its regulatory compliance and security, its multiasset approach has been one of the main reasons behind its success.

If you are an investor looking to gain access to new commodities markets without having to relearn what your previous endeavors taught you, Uphold might be a good choice for you.

Setting up your Uphold account is easy and painless, multiple funding and withdrawal methods are available, fees are accessible to low-volume investors, and security is top-notch.

However, if you are a frequent trader or plan to have a large portfolio, it might not be the right fit for you.

Uphold Features

Understanding what features are offered by a specific platform will be essential when deciding if it is the right fit for you or not. After all, long-term investors will want to have options such as staking in the case of crypto, allowing them to further profit from their investments.

Fortunately, Uphold is a platform that doesn’t lack in the feature department. Having said that, let’s take a look at the most critical features you will gain when using Uphold.

Desktop, Mobile, and Smartphone App

While this might sound like an unimportant feature, we find it to be extremely relevant in today’s world. Not only has technology changed how we can access our digital services but when it comes to investing, you need to be able to access your portfolio at any time.

Surprisingly, many major trading platforms don’t offer smartphone apps for their users to access their services.

The Uphold Wallet

If you were to find that your platform of choice didn’t have a smartphone app, your first thought would be to access the website from your phone’s browser.

Despite mobile traffic accounting for almost 59% of all internet traffic, many web developers don’t worry about making their code compatible with mobiles. If your portfolio needs immediate attention, having to go through the mess of an incompatible website is the last thing you want.

Be it with Uphold or any other platform, we always recommend making sure you have different means to access its features. This will not only save you headaches in the future but is also a testament to the platform’s readiness, commitment, and capabilities.

Cryptocurrency Exchange

Let’s start by repeating that Uphold has an “anything-to-anything” mentality, which means you can trade any asset for another at any given time. As such, while we will be talking about the different asset types as distinct, they can be exchanged for one another in reality. Having said that, let’s continue.

The Uphold Exchange

Uphold offers an excellent crypto trading platform to its users, supporting some of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the space. This crypto trading platform is available in its desktop, mobile, and Smartphone version, and will allow you to buy, sell, and trade crypto. Unfortunately, the platform only offers limited orders.

This lack of other order types means that advanced crypto traders will be greatly restricted in terms of what they can do. However, if you are a beginner or don’t use any other type of order, this won’t be a limitation at all but will make things easier for you.

Supported Cryptocurrencies

Uphold supports over 190 cryptocurrencies, giving traders of all levels a chance to access the crypto market with the certainty of not missing out on opportunities. These cryptocurrencies include altcoins, emerging tokens, stablecoins, and major currencies.

With the list of supported cryptocurrencies constantly expanding and changing, we recommend that you check the official page for any questions regarding supported currencies.

However, these are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies supported by Uphold:

BTC
XRP
ETH
BAL
BAT
ADA
COMP
ATOM
BCHBTG
DASH
DCR
DGB
DOGE
DOT
EOS
IOTA
Many, many more…
Precious Metals Exchange

Investing in precious metals might not be as popular as investing in equity or cryptocurrency but they remain one of the safest bets due to their tangible nature.

Precious metals are considered one of the best hedge methods there are, which is why most expert investors add them to their portfolios.

If you are interested in investing in precious metals, Uphold is a great option.

At Uphold, buying metals is easy

The platform makes it easy for anyone to invest in them without having to go through the hoops associated with acquiring them physically. This means no storage, transport, or permits have to be something you worry about: Just invest as you would with crypto or stocks!

The precious metals you can buy using Uphold are Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Palladium. Buying them is as easy as any other commodity and you can use any of the currencies or commodities supported by Uphold all thanks to that “anything-to-anything” capabilities!

Stock Exchange

Uphold allows its users to invest in tons of U.S stocks for some of the biggest companies in the world. No matter how expensive a stock is, fractional equities allow them to invest as little as 1 dollar, all while giving you proportional ownership and dividends.

This is the way in which Uphold has helped democratize a market that had historically been accessible to only a few.

U.S. Equities

The benefits of investing in stocks with Uphold are that there is no minimum investment amount, there are no account fees, equity can be sent to other people free of charge, easy funding, and much more.

In addition to this, you won’t have to worry about your favorite company not being available as over 40 stocks are available.

These include:

TSLA
AMZN
AAPL
GOOGL
ADBE
AMD
T
BABA
BA
BRK.B
CSCO
DIS

Just like with the supported cryptocurrencies, this list could change at any given time. As such, we recommend you check the official page for the latest information.

Environmental Assets

Environmental efforts have gained traction over the past decades as politicians, businesses, and everyday people join forces to help the environment. Now, you can join this fight by investing in projects designed to help tackle issues like climate change. Uphold is one of the few platforms allowing investors to do just that at this time.

Environmental assets are a form of Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) in which investors acquire assets like tradable carbon credit tokens and environmentally-conscious commodities.

By doing so, your investment is directly helping the environment either by ensuring no negative impact takes place or actively helping reverse the damage made by other activities.

Uphold only offers two environmental assets at the time of writing: Universal Carbon Tokens (UPCO2) and Bitcoin Zero (BTC0). The former is a crypto token minted through Ethereum which is backed 1:1 by verified carbon units, effectively making it a form of carbon credit.

Bitcoin zero, on the other hand, is a Bitcoin wrapper that has been rendered carbon neutral via UPCO2.

If you want to help the environment while investing, these 2 options are great. Not only are you investing in the underlying projects (Ethereum and Bitcoin) but also in the environmental movement itself. Make sure to check the latest information to be sure what your options are!

Limitless Orders

You might remember we mentioned that Uphold only supports limit orders. Worry not, this is not a mistake. Uphold’s “limitless orders” is a feature of sorts rather than an order type. This feature is one of our favorite things about Uphold as it can be integrated with several investment strategies.

Limitless orders allow users to place up to 50 limit orders at any given time using one pool of capital. What this means is that your funds are not taken away at the moment of creating an order but rather when it is executed.

As such, you no longer have to decide between 2 moves… You can create an order for both and the first one to have its condition met will be executed.

Combine this with Uphold’s “anything-to-anything” and you got yourself a recipe for effective investing. If you are worried about the resulting fees, there is no need. You will only be charged for the transaction that goes through, making it a win-win… All without having to constantly monitor the market.

Staking

Staking is one of the most popular and powerful tools available to crypto investors, allowing them to generate additional rewards. Staking has been possible since the inception of the “proof of stake” protocol in the blockchain world, becoming a major staple ever since.

When a user stakes its cryptocurrency, it is helping the blockchain network become more efficient and secure by improving the transaction verification process. As a result, the user starts generating rewards that come in the form of cryptocurrency most of the time.

Staking

The best part about it is that users don’t really need to do much after staking, just wait. This makes this feature incredibly useful for long-term investors.

Most of the dominant blockchain networks support staking at this time, with the exception of Ethereum and Bitcoin at the time of writing. However, Ethereum is working on making a shift that would allow users to stake their Ether. At this time,

Uphold supports staking for the following cryptocurrencies:

Kava (KAVA)
Kusama (KSM)
Polkadot (DOT)
Cosmos (ATOM)
Mina (MINA)
Polygon (MATIC)
Solana (SOL)
Tron (TRX)
Flow (FLOW)
Ethereum (ETH)
Tezos (XTZ)
Cardano (ADA)
Algorand (ALGO)

As usual, make sure to check the latest information to know all the options at any given time.

Automated Trading

Also known as AutoPilot, this feature allows you to automate your investing by setting up regular transactions, be it selling or buying. This is great for people using strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging as it will take all the work away from you.

This feature can be used to invest in all of the commodities supported by Uphold, as well as using them as payment methods. If you would rather use a debit card to fund your purchases, this is also possible.

Uphold Fees

While you won’t need to open an Uphold account, there are fees associated with some of the services like buying and selling.

This is the same model used by most investment platforms but with the main difference: Fees are locked pre-trade. This means you won’t have nasty surprises when executing orders.

Let’s start by talking about the fees you won’t be paying. These are deposit and withdrawal fees, as well as trading commissions. These are nonexistent.

The feelings you will need to pay attention to are “spreads”. This will differ for cryptocurrencies (depending on which one you are transacting with) and fiat currencies. In the case of crypto, buy spread fees can be between 1.25% and 0.95% while the sell spread will fall between 1.25% and 1.1%. In the case of fiat, the buy spread will be between 0.05% and 0.2% for buy and sell spreads.

You can find the latest information on fees here. As this can change at any time, we recommend you check them before using the platform. However, you will see how much you will incur in fees before completing a transaction as a result of Uphold commitment to transparency.

Uphold Customer Support

Customer support is just as important as features. Fortunately, Uphold is known for having one of the best customer support teams in the space. However, chances are that you won’t be needing them as the platform is extremely intuitive and easy to use.

In addition to this, Uphold offers resources like a Cryptionary, Blog, FAQ, Help Center, System status, and get started sections that do their job pretty well. You can also submit a request via the help center.

While Uphold doesn’t offer support via phone or chat, tickets are replied to in a timely manner. That being said, it is important to clarify that this was our personalñ experience with the customer support team.

Platforms like Trustpilot give Uphold a 2.5 rating, which is considered poor. As such, we recommend you give a look at some good and bad reviews and judge by yourself!

Is Uphold secure?

Uphold complies with all regulations required by the United States. Not only is all of its data encrypted but all security patches and systems are constantly monitored, pen-testing and auditing are regularly taking place, and access to the servers is closely regulated.

Over its more than 7 years of existence, Uphold has not been involved in any data leak or breach. This is not only due to the measures the team takes to protect data on its end but also to the platform offering 2-factor authentication and other features that increase security on the user’s end.

Conclusion

Uphold is one of the most solid choices for any user looking to invest, especially if you are looking to be exposed to several types of commodities. Its ease of use, top-notch security, high transparency when it comes to fees, and great accessibility make it a great option.

That being said, if you are looking for diverse order types or advanced features, you might want to look elsewhere. Popular features like loaning, debit/credit card issuing, advanced charting, and social trading are not supported.

Bitsgap at a Glance

Contents [Show]

Bitsgap is advertised as a new way to trade across multiple exchanges, by finding the best rates and effectively managing your portfolio. The platform allows you to bring all of these elements under one roof, providing access from a single account at the click of a button. It has carefully designed features that will enable you to:

Quickly compare rates from heaps of digital currency markets
Trade and instantly switch between different exchanges
Keep track of your investments

Test your strategies out via a demo account facility without risking any capital

Traders have access to 10,000+ cryptocurrency trading pairs and several technical indicators available to formulate your strategies. The platform offers an optimised and intuitive interface for both beginners and seasoned traders.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

"The Best Torrent Sites: Complete Guide to The Most Popular Sites","Torrents are files containing metadata, which is a data set containing information on other data. Therefore, a torrent does contain…","Torrents are files containing metadata, which is a data set containing information on other data. Therefore, a torrent does contain the content file. Instead, it helps torrent software search for “peers” or “seeds” that share the data. The program then extracts data from those shared files, producing a finished version of the data.

Think of it as using the torrent software to collect whatever movies, TV shows, music, or other content files you want from other people’s computers all around the world. That doesn’t mean that you need to give up your drive and all your information when you download a torrent, either.

The program collects pieces of data from shared files and puts them together on your computer or device. No-one has access to your information at any stage. The speed of the data transfer depends on the number of peers hosting the content for transfer. The seeds or peers, the faster the data transfer.

How Does a Torrent Work?

Contents [Show]

When you browse online, the browser sends multiple requests to servers every second to download information related to your browsing session. If the server can’t handle the request load from users on its network, it ends up crashing.

When browsing, the browser in use sends multiple requests to a server so that it can download the information.

However, this server can have too much traffic from users who are trying to access the same information. As a result, the servers crash, and everyone on the network loses their connection. Torrents work on “Peer-to-Peer” technology described above, by transferring data between systems. However, with P2P transfers, it’s possible to move large volumes of data on a platform, without experiencing any difficulties of overloading servers and networks. P2P transfers can occur on the BitTorrent protocol, a system used to transfer files online.

How BitTorrent Works

By installing a BitTorrent client on your device or computer, you can access these P2P networks, allowing you to download torrent files that contain all your favorite entertainment. You capture small pieces of information from all the seeds on the system, piecing together the data to allow you to host it on your device or PC.

The trackers in the torrent file make it easy for the protocol to identify the relevant data in the transfer, recording the number of seeds for the torrent file, as well as the total downloads, file size, and peers seeding the file.

“Leeching” describes a practice where people download the torrent file from the network, but don’t leave their connection available after to seed the data back to the system. The community frowns on this process, so if you have unlimited bandwidth available, consider giving back to the community some time.

BitTorrent, the company, was purchased by Justin Sun, Creator of the Tron Blockchain platform in 2018.

Disclaimer

While the BitTorrent protocol is entirely legal, the unapproved use of the software to download and distribute copyrighted content is illegal. The regulators are in a constant battle with torrent sites, with torrenters trying to prove that the use of trackers and BitTorrent metafiles don’t store any file contents.

Regulators will always be in a struggle with torrenting sites. Some sites have harder times with the authorities than others. However, it’s best to ensure that you remain anonymous online when using a torrent service.

Download and install a VPN for your device or laptop before you start downloading. Use a VPN when downloading. This tool safeguards you against any malicious activity from bad actors or third-party software while you’re surfing the web and downloading files.

The purpose of this article is for information purposes only. We are in no way suggesting that you use the information in this article to download copywritten material.

The Top 25 Torrent Sites

In this section, we’ll bring you some information on the best public trackers available. Most of the options in this review offer you a safe means of downloading torrents. However, remember to use a VPN and ensure that your internet security is tight before you attempt any downloads.

The Pirate Bay
Year Founded: 2003
Monthly active users: 106.08-million
Global Site Rank: 209

The Pirate Bay is the most infamous torrent site on the internet. This site got plenty of attention from Federal authorities, with law enforcement taking down many previous domains. However, you can’t suppress freedom for too long, and the Pirate Bay kept on popping up on different domains.

TPB is your one-stop torrent shop where everything is available for free. Movies, series, Blu-ray, HD 1080p, whatever you want – it’s all there, and it’s all for free. There are millions of torrents on the site. While a vast majority of them are porn, there’s still plenty of useful programs, applications, e-books, movies, series, and documentaries.

The Pirate Bay is a free site, and it doesn’t cost you anything to download, but tipping the developers through the Bitcoin or Monero crypto network is an excellent way to give back. You’ll find the wallet addresses for the community at the footer of the page.

This site features many millions of visitors every month. Still, it’s probably a lot more than the registered traffic, as plenty of the users utilize proxies, VPNs, or mirrors to gain safe access to The Pirate Bay. Alexa ranks TPB as the 209th most visited site online, but we bet it’s really in the top 100, at least.

Visit

YTS
Year Founded: 2010
Monthly active users: 118.6-million
Global Site Rank: 182

TPB is a popular site, but there are reports of it not being a safe place to download your torrents. Our top choice for the safest site with the best selection goes to YTS.am. YTS arrived to fill the gap left by the Motion Picture Association of America when it shut down YIFY, the predecessor to YTS.

YTS has all the latest releases, in varying levels of quality. HD and Blu-ray titles are available, and the user interface is easy to navigate. The search is functional, and you can find any old movie you want in the platform’s extensive archives.

Alexa ranks YTS as the 182nd most popular site online, with nearly 120-million unique visitors to the platform every month.

Rutracker
Year Founded: 2004
Monthly active users: 85.74-million
Global Site Rank: 256

Rutracker is one of the lesser-know torrenting websites. It’s popular in Russia but doesn’t get a lot of traction anywhere else in the world. It might surprise you to learn that Russia has its version of just about every western digital service. Gmail is Rumail, and the Pirate Bay is Rutracker.

Rutracker indexes everything in Russian, so unless you can speak the language, you’re going to have a tough time navigating your way through the site. You get a wide selection of torrents, including music, e-books, software, movies, and series.

It’s also strange to think that the Russian government banned and blocked the site in 2015, showing the average Russian’s ability to circumvent international cybersecurity laws using tools like a virtual private network (VPN).

According to Alexa, Rutracker ranks as the 256th most popular site online.

KickAssTorrents, otherwise known as KAT, was an example of how far the government is willing to go to allocate resources to protecting copyright. The US Department of Justice seized the original kat.cr website that was almost as big as Pirate Bay at the time.

In a miscarriage of justice in the fight against information freedom, the US prosecuted the owner of the website. However, proving once again that you can’t lock up the freedom of information, the site appeared under a new URL, katcr.co.

The new site features a vast library of torrents. Browse through the subcategories and choose your favorite movies, anime, TV shows, games, e-books, applications, software, and music. This site has an excellent interface that’s simple to use, and an elegant design that’s easy on the eyes.

Magnetdl is an innovative platform that allows for the referral of electronic files, without the continuous need for host swarms.

Magnet files are an excellent choice for identifying the content in files using cryptographic hashing, instead of the actual location of the file. As a result, anyone can create a file, with no central authority needing to provide issuance.

If you want to download magnet links, then you’ll need to have a BitTorrent client downloaded and installed on your computer. Qbittorent and uTorrent are some of the more popular choices for a BitTorrent client that can download magnet links.

The interface of the site has a minimalist feel, and after conducting the research, the site offers users the chance to download the file or stream it online.

Before the use of torrents for distributed peers, trackers were the only method of locating peers with content to share online. The usage of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) by BitTorrent clients helps to find peers for the file via a BitTorrent protocol. This system offers a means of distributing tracking, gaining significant popularity thanks to its decentralized approach of file transfers.

BTDigg relies on the use of DHT protocols for file searches, and the site itself provides a clean and user-friendly interface. The website collects metadata for the DHT network, and one of the key advantages is that no torrents are involved in the running of the site, and there is no content on the site’s servers.

Your search results display torrent-related information, such as the size, name, age, and the number of files. The listing also provides a single link for execution with your BitTorrent client.

What are the Advantages of Downloading Torrent?

There are plenty of advantages to using torrent downloads. The first reason is the entertainment on tap, there no need to pay for streaming services when you can download torrents for free.

You also get a better range of media on torrent sites. For instance, on the Pirate Bay, you can find movies, TV shows, series, documentaries, e-books, video games, software programs, and anime. That kind of selection isn’t available on any streaming site, and you’ll need multiple subscriptions to handle that kind of action.

With torrent files, you also get to keep the files. That’s especially important when you’re dealing with software programs and e-books. Transferring data in a P2P manner also benefits business.

It’s for this reason that many companies that handle large volumes of data now integrate P2P solutions in systems to save on bandwidth and server storage space.

Are There Any Disadvantages in Downloading Torrent Files?

As you can see, there are plenty of advantages to using P2P file transfers. Torrents are handy ways to share information, but there are also risks and limitations associated with handling torrents.

For instance, access to secured files is easy to manage through servers, but it’s far more challenging with torrents. The backup files on the server also assure that it’s easy to restore files if the central hub shuts down.

Downloading torrents can also consume plenty of bandwidth. If you’re working on a limited data plan, then make sure you check your consumption. If you decide to seed back to the network, then you’ll also be using bandwidth for this process.

Do I Need a VPN to Download Torrents?

No, you don’t need to have a VPN if you want to download torrents online – but you should. There are thousands of stories about how torrent sites can damage your data and your machine.

Countless stories are floating around online, from installing viruses and malware in torrents downloaded to computers, to identity theft and extortion. The internet is a wild place, and you need protection to keep your identity and data safe while downloading torrents.

Using these sites without the assistance of a VPN is like walking down the road naked. Everyone starts paying attention to you, and some people might want to come in for a closer look. If they think you have something of value to offer them, they might decide to rob you.

However, being robbed online isn’t the same as in the real world. If some thug sticks you up in an alleyway with a knife, you know that someone robbed you.

However, online, you won’t even realize it happened until you get a call from the credit agencies saying you suddenly are outstanding with a large loan payment you never knew existed.

Identity theft and fraud online is a real thing, and you need to protect yourself and your computer from any online threats that could cost you your livelihood.

Which VPN to use?

We have reviewed a number of VPNs, as follows:

Avast VPN
Express VPN
Nord VPN
CyberGhost VPN
AVG VPN
Pure VPN
How Does a VPN Work?

A VPN is a third-party software available from numerous providers. After downloading and installing the software on your machine, you open a user dashboard.

On your dash, you’ll see servers listed in various countries, such as the USA and UK. By clicking onto one of these servers, you route your connection to the internet through the proxy addresses used by the VPN. As a result, your ISP and hackers can’t see you online; essentially – you’re invisible.

Therefore, with a VPN, you don’t have to worry about anyone discovering your IP address. You also don’t have any concerns about someone accessing your machine remotely through a virus. A VPN offers you the safest means of downloading torrents.

How do I Download a Torrent?

Downloading a torrent is easy. All you need to do is download a torrent client, install it on your device or PC. After its running, log in to any of the sites mentioned in this review.

Follow this step-by-step process for downloading your first torrent file.

Step 1 – Download a torrent client like uTorrent or qbittorrent from an official website.
Step 2 – Search the torrent site for your media file
Step 3 – Click the magnet icon on the file you want to download
Step 4 – Select the path or drive to save the file on your device or PC
Step 5 – Click OK, and start your download

NOTE: Priority will always go to the first file that starts downloading when working with simultaneous downloads or multiple files.

Using torrents to access your favorite media, software, and internet tools is a great way to stay entertained while stuck indoors.

As long as you have an internet connection or Wi-Fi, you can always download torrents.

What are the Types of Torrent Sites?

We can categorize torrent sites into private and public venues. Public torrent sites, also known as “open trackers,” will permit access to any user when accessing the tracker address. Fortunately, downloading files from these platforms is a straightforward process.

Private torrent sites, otherwise known as private trackers, will limit access to members. In most cases, members are only able to register through invite-only. Existing members must approve permission for new members to access the platform and issue an entrance code via email.

Private sites may also require members to meet specific seeding goals to keep the network alive.

Public trackers offer you the best option for ease of use. These platforms are open, so the chance of downloading a bad piece of software or malware is a risk you’ll have to learn to mitigate if you want to continue to download torrents.

The advantage of private trackers is that the members all experience a vetting process before joining the network. Therefore, there is much less risk of a malicious software ending up in your torrent transfer.","https://blockonomi.com/best-torrent-sites/"

The global exchange and third-party broker is home to some of the largest trading volumes in the space, alongside a fee-structure that should suit most budgets.

In this guide, we review the ins and outs of KuCoin. This includes an in-depth look at the platform’s supported coins, fiat currency facilities, fees and commissions, safety, customer support, and trading arena.

What is KuCoin?

Contents [Show]

Launched as recently as 2017, KuCoin is a cryptocurrency exchange that also offers third-party brokerage services. Although the platform has just three years of trading history, it is now one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the space.

One of the main reasons for this is that you will find over 200 coins with about 450 cryptocurrency pairs hosted at the exchange. Not only does this include major pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, but heaps of crypto-cross pairs. Best of all, if you have an appetite to trade a less liquid ERC-20 token, chances are you will find it at KuCoin.

Kucoin Homepage

KuCoin was initially a cryptocurrency-only platform, meaning that you could not deposit funds with fiat currency. However, the platform has since formed a partnership with Simplex – a European payment provider that bridges the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday money.

When it comes to cryptocurrency trading fees, KuCoin charges just 0.10%. This puts it on par with the likes of Binance. Similarly, KuCoin is also behind its own digital token – KuCoin Shares (KCS). By owning and storing KCS tokens, you will benefit from discounted trading fees, as well as an entitlement to a share of the trading commissions that KuCoin collects.

In terms of the numbers, KuCoin claims to have facilitated more than 650 million individual trades since its inception in 2017. This translates to more than $71 billion in accumulated trading volumes.

Finally – and as we cover in more detail further down, KuCoin is not regulated by a national licensing body. Although this means that you will be able to trade cryptocurrencies without supplying any ID, this won’t be the case if you wish to buy digital coins with a debit/credit card through Simplex.

What can you Trade at KuCoin?

KuCoin offers a vast range of financial instruments that goes above and beyond just crypto-to-crypto pairs. On the contrary, the platform also offers cryptocurrency indexes, margin trading, and even futures.

Let’s explore each asset class in more detail.

Crypto-to-Crypto Pairs

Each and every trading pair at KuCoin falls within the remit of crypto-to-crypto, not least because it does not offer any fiat-denominated instruments. Instead, you will need to trade your chosen cryptocurrency against the USDT if you want access to the crypto-to-USD space.

If you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency trader then you will know first hand that this is industry standard anyway, so you’ll have no issues with trading volumes or liquidity.

Outside of USDT, you can trade crypto-cross pairs. Examples of this include BTC/ETH, ETH/XRP, and BSC/BTC. Ultimately, listing each and every trading digital currency is beyond the remit of this review, albeit, rest assured that the platform hosts more than 450 pairs.

Some of the Kucoin markets

Crucially, KuCoin is often one of the very first exchanges that newly launched cryptocurrency token projects opt for. As such, support for less liquid digital tokens is something that the team at KuCoin actively look to facilitate.

For a full breakdown of each and every pair that KuCoin hosts, you can find this information here at CoinMarketCap.

KuCoin Indexes

On top of traditional crypto-cross pairs, KuCoin also offers a number of indexes. The concept here is that KuCoin will take the weighted average of a specific cryptocurrency across several leading exchanges.

This is with the view of offering a more accurate price of the coin in question, as it takes into account the variations that you often find between competing platforms.

KuCoin indexes are available across:

Bitcoin
Ethereum
Ripple
Litecoin

The cryptocurrency exchanges that KuCoin derives its pricing activity from are:

Coinbase
Bitstamp
Kraken
Gemini
Bittrex
Liquid

The price of each index is denominated in USD, but settled in the respective cryptocurrency.

KuCoin Futures

Launched in mid-2019, the KuCoin Mercantile Exchange allows you to trade Bitcoin futures. KuCoin itself notes that it is looking to challenge the likes of BitMEX in this particular area of the cryptocurrency derivative space. As a result, you will have access to Bitcoin futures alongside a substantial margin position of up to 100x.

In simple terms, this means that a $100 account balance would permit a maximum trade value of $10,000. When it comes to the underlying spot price, KuCoin once again takes the weighted average from various leading exchanges – such as Kraken, Coinbase Pro, and Bitstamp.

Kucoin Futures

At the time of writing, KuCoin only supports BTC and ETH futures, although it hopes to add further digital currencies in the near future. When it comes to fees, expect to pay 0.060% as a market taker, and 0.020% as a maker. There are also settlement fees of 0.025%.

Trading Fees and Commissions

First and foremost, there are no fees associated with cryptocurrency deposits, and withdrawals are charged at the standard mining rate as per the coin you are looking to cash out.

When it comes to trading fees outside of the futures arena, you will pay 0.1%. This means that a $10,000 trade would cost you $10 in fees. As we briefly mentioned earlier, this sits in-line with fellow exchange counterpart Binance.

KuCoin Shares (KCS)

KuCoin Shares – or simply KCS, is a proprietary cryptocurrency token created by the exchange. By owning and holding KCS tokens you will be accustomed to a number of benefits.

This includes:

Discounted Trading Fees

One of the most notable benefits of holding KuCoin Shares is that you will get discounted trading fees. Crucially, while a standard fee of 0.1% is industry-leading, you stand the potential to reduce this by an additional 20%. What you need to do is to simply turn on the KCS Pay Fee button and enjoy the discount.

Dividends

On top of reducing your trading commissions, holding an allocation of KuCoin Shares affords you the opportunity to earn dividends. In a nutshell, KuCoin as a platform will distribute 50% of the trading commissions that it collects from members each and every day.

This is then distributed proportionately across all holders of KuCoin Shares. For example, let’s suppose that you hold 1% of the entire KCS supply. If the platform pays out $250,000 in commissions, you would receive $2,500. You need to hold at least 6 KCS to benefit from the dividends.

Price History and Buying KuCoin Shares

To say the value of KuCoin Shares has capitulated since its all-time highs of January 2018 would be an understatement. At a peak of over $20 each, you can now obtain the very same tokens for less than $1 in mid-2020.

Nevertheless, if you do want to get your hands on KuCoin Shares you can do this by exchanging them at the platform for an alternative cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Fiat Currency Facilities at KuCoin

As the end of 2018, KuCoin has since formed a partnership with European-based payment provider Simplex. The partnership ensures that users from over 100 countries can now deposit real-world funds with a debit or credit card.

This is ideal if you are looking to trade cryptocurrencies, futures at KuCoin but you do not have any digital currencies available to you. Instead, you can simply enter your debit/credit card details and get cash directly into the platform.

Purchase crypto with credit card

With that being said, it is important to note that the fees associated with this are not cheap. Although the occasional promotion is offered on deposit fees, this will cost you a whopping 2.5 – 3.5% (with a $10 minimum).

This means that a $1000 debit/credit card deposit would cost you $25 in fees. It is noticed that this is slightly cheaper than the likes of Coinbase, which charges 3.99% (with various minimums in place).

Also, KuCoin is developing an OTC Trading Desk, on which all users could buy and sell major coins like BTC, USDT, PAX without any fee. The OTC platform currently supports USD, CAD, CNY, IDR and VND.

Trading Platforms

KuCoin offers a proprietary trading platform that was built from the ground-up. There is no requirement to download or install any software to your desktop device, as the KuCoin trading arena can be accessed through your standard web browser. The platform is potentially suited to both newbie investors and seasoned traders.

The reason we say this is that while the platform is super-clean and easy to navigate through, there are heaps of advanced tools available at your disposal. In fact, you have the ability to fully customize your KuCoin trading screen however you see fit.

Kucoin Trading Screen

When it comes to trading volumes and the availability of liquidity, you should have no concerns at all when trading more popular pairs. You might, however, find that volumes are low on less liquid pairs – especially those involving ERC-20 tokens.

Mobile Trading

If you have a tendency to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies on the move, then you might be interested in the KuCoin mobile trading app.

The application is available to download on iOS and Android devices. You will have access to most account features on the app, such as placing orders, checking the value of your portfolio, and depositing and withdrawing funds.

How Long do Withdrawals Take at KuCoin?

In the vast majority of cases, KuCoin will process your withdrawals within 30 minutes of receiving the request. The platform notes that this is automated, and that manual authorization is only required if the size of your deposit is larger than 100,000 times that of the handling fee (mining fee).

Once the funds leave KuCoin, they will be transferred to the cryptocurrency wallet address of your choosing. Make sure that the address is valid, as there is nothing that KuCoin can do if you make an error!

Kucoin Withdrawals
Earn Interest at KuCoin

An additional feature available at KuCoin is that of its lending program. In its most basic form, you stand the chance of earning interest on your digital currency holdings by loaning it out. The main concept is that the tokens will be used to help fund margin accounts.

For example, let’s suppose that a KuCoin trader decides to apply leverage of 10x on an order. For each day that the position is kept open overnight, the trader would need to pay interest. This is because they are trading with more than they have in their account and thus – this comes at a cost.

Earn interest lending your cryptocurrency

With that said, KuCoin has opened its doors to everyday investors by giving you the opportunity to fund margin positions. This is available on several coins – including USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and many more.

In terms of the specific interest rate, this will vary from coin to coin. As an example, by lending out Bitcoin for 28 days, you could be earning an annualized interest rate of 4.83%.

If this is something that you are interested in exploring, KuCoin offers a profit estimation calculator. You simply need to specify how much you are willing to lend out, on what digital currency, and for what length of time – and the calculator will advise you how much you can earn.

It is important to remember that although the rates of interest on offer are super-competitive, you must consider the risks associated with this. After all, KuCoin is not a regulated cryptocurrency exchange so you must factor this into your risk vs reward model.

Is KuCoin Safe?

As is the case with all cryptocurrency exchanges, it is crucial that you are able to ascertain whether or not KuCoin is safe. Not only does this include the platform’s regulatory standing, but its internal and external security practices, too.

Let’s break these metrics down in more detail.

Regulation

In a nutshell, KuCoin is not regulated by any national licensing bodies. This isn’t a major surprise in the cryptocurrency exchange arena, as lots of platforms choose to operate without a license. Whether or not you feel comfortable trading at an unregulated exchange depends on what side of the fence you sit on.

For example, if you are the type of trader that prefers to buy and sell cryptocurrency pairs in an anonymous nature, then there is every chance that a platform like KuCoin is suitable for your needs. At the other end of the spectrum, if you are the type of trader that demands a regulatory safeguard of some sort, then KuCoin might not suffice.

KYC

As noted above, KuCoin is not required to ask you for any personal information – nor will they demand sensitive identity documents. However, the one exception to this rule is if you plan to deposit funds with a debit or credit card through the Simplex integration.

In fact, in order to remain compliant with all relevant laws surrounding anti-money laundering, you will need to upload a copy of your government-issued ID (passport or driver’s license). This is just the nature of the game when using fiat currency at a crypto-exchange.

KuCoin Security Practices

In terms of internal security practices, KuCoin claims to run institutional-grade systems that ensures it keeps crime away from the platform. This is fully supported by a commitment to cold storage.

Although the exact percentage is not specified by KuCoin, it is claimed that the vast bulk of client funds are held offline. The remainder is kept in hot wallets to ensure the platform is able to meet its offering of near-instant and automated withdrawals.

To date, there have been no publications of KuCoin encountering a major hack of any sort, which is an excellent sign. With that said, you always need to ensure you understand the risks of a potential external hack, as your funds are being stored in wallets that you do not personally control.

Also, it is worth noting that in April 2020, KuCoin completed a strategic cooperation with Onchain Custodian, Singapore’s crypto asset custody platform. Onchain Custodian will offer custody service for the safekeeping of KuCoin crypto assets. The custodial funds will be backed by Lockton, the world’s largest private insurance brokerage company. This is believed to further enhance the exchange’s security level.

2FA

Best of all, KuCoin allows you to install two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account. This means that a unique code will be sent to your mobile device whenever you wish to perform key account functions. This includes logging into your account and making a withdrawal request.

KuCoin Customer Support

When it comes to customer service, the team at KuCoin provides an around the clock support team that operates 24 hours per day – 7 days per week. You can send the team an email, albeit, if you need instant one-on-one support you are best advised to use the live chat facility.

Kucoin Customer Support

Sentiment on this is somewhat mixed in the public domain. With some users reporting connection times in the seconds, others have noted that waiting times are beyond acceptable. With that said, it all depends on how busy the team is at the time of the request. There is no telephone support service offered.

How to get Started at KuCoin

Like the sound of KuCoin and think the platform is suitable for your long-term trading needs? If so, we are now going to show you what you need to do to get started with a trading account today.

Step 1: Open an Account

To get the ball rolling, head over to the KuCoin homepage and click on the ‘Sign Up’ button at the top of the screen. You will then be prompted to enter your email address and to choose a strong password.

You will need to verify your email address before linking up 2FA via your mobile phone. At this stage of the registration process, you will not be asked for any personal information.

Kucoin Signup
Step 2: Deposit Funds

Once you have opened your KuCoin account you will then be promoted to deposit some funds. In this respect, you have two options. If you already possess a digital token, you can deposit this straight into KuCoin.

Simply head over to the deposit page and search for the respective coin. Then, click on the deposit tab to reveal your unique wallet address for that specific cryptocurrency.

Copy the address to your clipboard, head over to your private wallet, specify the number of coins you wish to deposit, and confirm the transaction.

Depending on the cryptocurrency you are depositing, it typically takes around 10-20 minutes for the funds to be credited into your KuCoin account.

Fiat Currency Deposit

If you do not have access to a digital currency, you will need to deposit funds with your debit or credit card. Hover over the ‘Buy Crypto’ button and then click on ‘Buy with Credit Card’.

Follow the step-by-step instructions that are presented to you on screen. Crucially, you will be asked to verify your identity before you are able to use your debit/credit card. The end-to-end process is taken care of by Simplex.

Step 3: Start Trading

As soon as your KuCoin account has been funded, you are ready to start trading. The specific trading arena that you need will depend on the type of financial instrument you are looking to access. This is because KuCoin separates its cryptocurrency exchange and future derivative platforms.

KuCoin Review: The Verdict?

In summary, it is clear to see why KuCoin is now one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the space. Not only does it give you access to over 450 cryptocurrency pairs, but you can also trade crypto-specific indexes and Bitcoin futures.

Moreover, standard trading fees amount to just 0.1%, which you can reduce by an additional 20% by paying fee with KuCoin Shares. We also like the fact that you can now deposit funds with a debit or credit card, albeit, you will need to bypass a KYC process first.

The main gripe that we have with KuCoin is that it is not a regulated entity. While this does mean that you can trade crypto-to-crypto pairs anonymously, your funds are never 100% safe.

On the flip side, reports about a KuCoin hack are yet to surface since its inception in 2017 – which is an excellent sign.

"AVG VPN Review: Not The Best Provider, Slow Speeds & Will Share Your Logs","Our VPN reviews are here to help you make an informed decision before committing to a service provider. We review…","Our VPN reviews are here to help you make an informed decision before committing to a service provider. We review all of the top VPN providers to find out who has the better offering. If you’re in the market for online protection, then we have a comprehensive list of VPN providers. We measure all of our reviews using the key metrics of pricing, performance, security, privacy, support, and features.

In this review, we take a look at AVG Secure VPN. Considering we used AVG free anti-virus in the past with excellent result, we were expecting big things from AVG with the release of this software. Read on to see how AVG measures up to the competition.

Visit AVG VPN

AVG VPN

Contents [Show]

Before the rise of Microsoft Security Essentials, AVG anti-virus was the most popular free security software on the internet. Everyone used AVG free in the early days of the internet, and it’s still around today.

With demand for its anti-virus products lagging behind other industry leaders, it appears that the management team at AVG are intent on diversifying their strategy into other related security products.

As a result, we have the launch of AVG VPN, a product designed to protect your online activities.

We have to say that we were excited to give this software a try, but after installing the client and reviewing the features, we were a bit disappointed. After analyzing the performance, things were not looking good for AVG.

Let’s unpack AVG Secure VPN and review it piece by piece.

AVG Secure VPN Pricing

We start with the pricing. While AVG free anti-virus didn’t cost a cent to download, install, and use – AVG Secure VPN it a different animal. The company charge for this product and they are not afraid to drop a hefty price tag on their product. Perhaps the company thought that their reputation in the market allows them to enter at a premium price level.

AVG adopt a different pricing structure to other VPN providers. AVG offers all the features of their VPN to their customers, regardless of the subscription they choose. There is no monthly or quarterly option on the VPN, with only annual plans available. AVG offers you a discount model if you decide to choose a 2-year or 3-year subscription to the service.

Your monthly cost for the software equates to $6.66 a month if you choose the annual plan, and AVG discounts the rate to $6.11 per month on the 3-year plan. We like the fact that they offer the VPN on a free 30-day trial, and your purchase comes backed with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

We also enjoyed that the free trial asked us for no personal information; we click on the download button and execute the file to run the program. After the trial period expires, AVG cancels your service if you don’t take a subscription.

Be careful of your data consumption while using the free version. AVG put a 10GB cap on your downloads for the free trial, and we imagine that many users will burn through this on the first day. If you exceed the limit, then you no longer qualify for the money-back guarantee on your purchase of the software.

AVG also revokes your money-back guarantee if you log onto the internet more than 100-times using the VPN. We found this a sneaky marketing tactic, as most other VPN providers don’t mention these types of restrictions in their “no questions asked” refund policies.

The pricing for AVG Secure VPN is as follows;

3-Years US$6.11 per month.
2-Years US$6.24 per month.
1-year US$6.66 per month.

It’s also important to note that AVG charges for the entire subscription fee upfront. Considering that the pricing is higher than many other premium VPNs, such as Nord VPN or Private Internet Access, this puts AVG on the back foot from the get-go. We hope that the performance of this product justifies the price tag.

Payment Options

It seems that from the moment you commit to purchase AVG Secure VPN, that where everything starts to go wrong. After pulling us through to the payment page, we find that AVG only offers payment for their software with a credit card or PayPal. Now while that suits us fine, we imagine that international customers would like to see alternative payment options like WorldPay, AliPay or Cryptocurrency.

Also, when we contacted one of our friends in Africa, they said that they only had the option to pay with a credit card, and PayPal was not available.

We would like to see the inclusion of more payment systems, as it gives us confidence in the fact that there is demand for the product in emerging markets, meaning that their servers must have a global footprint, and the service works well all over the globe.

Cryptocurrency payments are not available through AVG, which is a pity – especially since we think this payment method is a favorite among people who take online security seriously.

AVG Secure VPN Refund Policy

Most VPN providers offer a free trial of their software, or they issue you with a money-back guarantee with your purchase. AVG decided to do both.

Provided you comply with the rules of the refund, (less than 10GB or downloads, and fewer than 100-session logins,) then you qualify for a refund at any stage of the 30-day guarantee period.

We found the refund process to be painless, and all we needed to do was email the support desk with our refund request.

The company did not send us through customer retention, and they issued the refund the same day. The money returned to our credit card account in 8-business days after receiving the refund receipt.

Headquartered in the Czech Republic – A Data Safe Haven

The “14-Eyes,” is a collaborative effort between the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., and mainland Europe. The project has the goal of surveilling all internet data. If you select a VPN provider within the jurisdiction of the 14-Eyes, then you run the risk of the government picking up on your data usage and browsing history.

In this case, using a VPN residing within the 14-Eyes jurisdiction is a waste of time – it goes against what you are using a VPN for in the first place. Therefore, if you want to remain secure and anonymous in your online activities, you need to choose a VPN provider that resides out of the watchful stare of the 14-Eyes.

Fortunately, AVG Secure VPN has its headquarters in the Czech Republic, away from the 14-eyes jurisdiction. This location gives AVG management the right to refuse to co-operate with any government subpoena for data logs on the company’s users.

Privacy Policy and Data Collection

AVG Secure VPN claim that they have a “no-logs” policy. This statement means that they do not record what you do online with their VPN product. This policy is a key criterion for a VPN, and many users trust their service provider to keep their activities private and secure.

However, AVG does mention that if they receive reports of abuse, they will investigate the claim. The company also claims that they do not allow their customers to use the VPN service to share or distribute pirated content. This clause is pretty standard for the course, but we don’t see this type of language in the terms and conditions of many other VPN providers.

What caught our attention was when we read through the privacy policy for all AVG products, including the VPN service.

It turns out that AVG is collecting a substantial amount of data on its users, and storing them in their servers. Email addresses, phone numbers, SIM card numbers, location data, and your I.P. address are a few examples of the account data accessed by AVG, which can identify you online.

AVG state that they also have the right to share your data with interested third parties, and this includes handing over your session logs to law enforcement if they subpoena the company.

We can’t accept these terms of service, and we find it appalling that AVG would promote their product without clearly informing their customers of these terms. Essentially, there is very little protection on offer from the company, and they will hang you out to dry if the 14-Eyes demand it to be so.

AVG is part of the Avast Group, with headquarters in Amsterdam. Their senior management comprises of U.S. citizens, and we don’t see any reason for them to avoid requests from the 14-Eyes.

User-Interface

We enjoy using apps with clean interfaces – there’s nothing worse than opening an app to a cluttered dashboard; that’s why we appreciate apps with clean interfaces. However, saying that AVG Secure VPN has a clean c-panel would be an understatement.

The AVG Secure VPN dash has very few features. The only data available on the main screen is your server location and connection status. Call us picky – but we would like to see other features like our current I.P. address and connection speed.

Considering the bare-bones nature of the main screen, we are surprised to see that it takes up so much space when we open the desktop client. The main screen gives you access to the list of server locations by clicking the “change location” button, which opens the server list in a separate window.

We enjoyed the look and feel of the server lists, as AVG have all of their locations listed by continent, making it easy to select your ideal server location. We would have preferred it if the software allowed us to save our favorite server locations.

Clicking the gear icon in the top right-hand corner takes you through to the settings menu. These settings are very basic, with options for automatic startup, as well as an option to turn on Wi-Fi security. We didn’t find any configurable settings, giving the VPN a very out-of-the-box feel, and we would have liked to see more customizable configurations for the software.

Connection and Speed

AVG state that the connection speeds for their VPN have significantly improved as they expand their server network. When connecting to local U.S. servers, we experienced rates between 45 to 50-Mbps, which is more than adequate for streaming and fast download times.

Connecting to the United States servers from the U.K. was a bit slower, but still offered satisfactory speeds of 40-Mbps. The further we get into mainland Europe, the lower the speed tests. Fortunately, connection speeds to Australia were faster than most competitors, with average rates clocking in at 30-Mbps.

We found that uploads were not as consistent as downloads, but that par for the course with most VPN providers. However, slow upload may deter people who are frequent users of P2P services.

While speed was excellent, we found the latency to be unacceptably high. Even when connecting to servers in the same city as our geographic location, we found ping time to measure in at 16-ms, which is a terrible performance.

These latency issues mean that many gamers will have problems playing live, and may want to consider another VPN service. Our research into other VPNs shows average latency times of 2-ms for local connections, making AVG one of the worst providers available.

Security and Encryption

When it comes to rating the security and encryption of AVG Secure VPN, we also found it lacking in some departments. The Wi-Fi protection offers adequate countermeasures to avoid public hacks in open Wi-Fi spots, but users with privacy concerns may want to look into other software if they use open networks frequently.

Both the Windows client and Android app, we tested use OpenVPN protocol, with no option to switch to other protocols in the settings. We found this frustrating, as AVG does not mention this in their sales material, and we needed to use the support chat to discover this fact.

The encryption uses the industry standard 256-bit model, which is a military-grade encryption level offering the highest level of security to users. Our biggest gripe with AVG Secure VPN is that they don’t provide an internet kill switch with the software.

Should your connection fail, then the program will expose your real I.P. address – this is an unacceptable feature to leave out of the package, especially when we consider the subscription price being in the premium segment of the market.

Our DNS leak tests gave us no issues, and we pleased to find that the connection remained stable for most of our session, without any drops.

Netflix Blocked for Most Locations

One of the favorite uses of a VPN is the fact that it can get around geoblocks preventing you from watching certain content online. By routing your connection through a VPN, you can connect to services like the U.S. version of Netflix.

While most VPN providers have dedicated Netflix servers for streaming, it’s clear that AVG does not think this feature is worth adding to its service. When we tried to watch the U.S. version of Netflix, we found that more than half of the server locations we tried did not gain access to the site.

We did eventually establish a connection using the North American services, but their dedicated streaming servers proved to be worthless in our testing.

Limited Torrenting and P2P Locations

Downloading Torrent files is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for using a VPN service. Once again, AVG falls short in this department. We tested Torrenting on their dedicated P2P servers and found results to be less than impressive.

At the moment, AVG allows Torrenting through the following dedicated servers.

London.
Paris.
Prague.
Frankfurt.
Amsterdam.
Brazil.
Seattle.
Miami.
New York.

However, while the Windows client lists Brazil as an active P2P server, we find that it does not show up on the Android app as a valid P2P location.

The limited choice available may turn off those P2P users that rely on faster upload times. Fortunately, AVG does not limit bandwidth to these servers, so you have no limits on file size or restrictions on session bandwidth consumption.

User-Friendly App

We downloaded the Android app for our smartphone to test the mobile functionality of the program. As a note, the app is also available for all iOS devices as well. Similar to the desktop client, the app has a 30-day trial period with the same terms and conditions as the desktop client.

After downloading and installing the app, we opened the interface to find a clean, user-friendly control panel – with hardly any features. Like the desktop client, the mobile app is extremely sparse in terms of features and functionality.

The app automatically chooses the server that’s offering the best speeds, and the optimized server can vary depending on your location. This type of functionality is similar to what we see with other VPN apps, so it’s nothing to get us excited.

By clicking the “change location” button, you gain access to the server list and can make your choice manually. You also have the option to choose dedicated servers in the mobile app. Overall, the app is user-friendly, but we think that’s because it is so featureless that there is nothing to include in the control panel.

Navigating the settings is easy, but once again, there is no option to customize your settings configuration.

AVG Secure VPN Server Locations

AVG may advertise an extensive server network, but when we take a look at what’s on offer, it tells a different story. There are limited server locations, especially outside of the United States, with AVG hosting servers in 29-cities across 21-countries.

Seven of the locations reside in the Us, with servers in New York, Chicago, Miami, Dallas, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle. Montreal and Toronto house the company’s Canadian servers.

Europe has the next most extensive concentration of servers, with locations in London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Helsinki, Paris, Milan, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Russia, Warsaw, and the Czech Republic.

International locations include Johannesburg in South Africa, Australia, Tokyo, and Singapore, along with servers in Turkey. South America has server locations in Mexico City and Sao Paolo, Brazil.

The list is not impressive, and we found that speeds outside of the US, Canada, and Europe, to be relatively weak compared to other VPN providers.

Customer Support

AVG doesn’t give a hoot about customer service from our experience with the company. The website has limited information on their products, and the email support took 48-hours to get back to us with a simple query.

Almost every other VPN provider offers a live chat, and when we have issues, it’s the first place we go to for support. AVG does not provide this service –which is very disappointing.

Other VPN Providers

Some other providers we have covered before on Blockonomi are as follows:

CyberGhost
Avast Secureline
NordVPN
ExpressVPN
Wrapping Up – The Verdict

If you’re looking to buy an over-priced VPN that may or may not track your movements on the internet, then AVG is the ideal product for you. However, if you have serious concerns over your privacy, you’re a gamer, or you enjoy downloading and uploading P2P, then AVG is a poor choice.

Considering the cost of this software, and the functionality – AVG leaves a lot to be desired from its offering. While the basic functionality of the VPN is adequate, the costs are not great, and we feel you would be better off going with another VPN provider, like ExpressVPN or NordVPN.

Taking a brief overlook of the pros and cons of this software, we find;

Pros

Comfortable, clean user interface.
U.S. and U.K. servers offer decent streaming speeds.
30-day trial.
30-day money-back guarantee.

Cons

Deceptive refund terms.
Minimal features and no configurable settings.
Limited server performance and locations.
Shady data and logging policies.
Average customer support levels.
Poor pricing for what’s on offer.

This VPN is probably the bottom of the barrel, The legacy behind AVG had our hopes up for this product. However, after spending a few days using the VPN, we find it to be lacking in several notable features, the performance is nothing worth shouting about and their privacy / no-log policy is very poor.

The bottom line? Look for another product.

Orders Types

Unsurprisingly, ATFX offers market order execution. Market orders are sent to the market, then executed at the market’s tradeable price. Following execution, the information regarding the transaction will go to the MT4 platform. The execution price for market orders is influenced by the amount of liquidity from banks and if it is enough. It can change rapidly. Remember that the MT4 platform will send the transaction instructions to the given MT4 server.

ATFX offers a range of order types to choose from. Pending order options include Buy Limit, Buy Stop, Sell Stop, and Sell Limit. A Take Profit or Stop Less closes pending orders. All pending orders connect to company instructions within the server. The pending order is triggered, then transacted and executed in the form of a market order.

As expected from a broker, ATFX does indeed have an economic calendar. The broker refers to it as a “live forex news calendar.” The calendar is automatically updated so traders can have the latest information. It also includes the ability to check past events in the history. For each event on the calendar, you will see the time, currency, importance, event, actual, forecast, and previous figures.

ATFX Awards

Over the years, ATFX has earned numerous awards across various markets. It was named the Best NDD Forex Broker 2018 from the Online Personal Wealth AwardsMoneyAM. ATFX was also honored with Best Forex Customer Services 2017 at the Entrepreneur JFEX Awards and 13th Jordan Forex Expo.

How Does ATFX Protect Client Funds?

ATFX has a strong commitment to ensuring that client funds remain safe at all times. The company uses the latest encryption technology currently available to protect data. This is combined with effective protection measures and strict supervision. The result is a trading environment that is safe and reliable.

Additionally, ATFX segregates client funds in trust accounts. Its custodian bank is Barclays Bank PLC. Holding client funds in segregated accounts ensures the funds are always separate from those of ATFX. Furthermore, if something happens to ATFX and it becomes insolvent, your funds are safe. Since they are segregated, they cannot be used to reimburse creditors.

To add to the protections in the unlikely event of insolvency, AT Global Markets (UK) Limited clients have FSCS coverage. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme is available to clients in organizations regulated by the FCA. The scheme comes into play in the rare case that ATFX cannot satisfy its repayment claims. In this situation, the FSCS provides as much as £50,000 in compensation per person for eligible investments.

ATFX also has its own self-developed accounting system which is automatic. It ensures that withdrawals are only possible when the identity of the client matches the information on the account. For further finance transparency, ATFX has partnerships with EY, a professional audit organization.

How Do You Contact ATFX?

For the convenience of clients, ATFX offers multiple methods of contacting the team. There are main phone lines available on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., UK time. There is an 800 number from the UK and a separate number for calls from outside the UK. Or you can send an email to the relevant department. The Contact Us section of the ATFX website lists all. Email addresses are for general information, complaints/disputes, partnerships, support, and sales inquiries. You can also contact support via live chat in the bottom right corner of the page.

ATFX Help Center

One area in which ATFX is lacking is a help center. Most brokers have an obvious help center or section with FAQs. There is no such obvious section of the ATFX website. Instead, there are webinars and there is ready information for contacting customer support. There are some sections with FAQs, such as those related to trading. Overall, however, there is no convenient way to find information on other FAQs. It would be nice to have a dedicated section for information such as this. It would make it easier to open an account, fund the account, and do basic troubleshooting without contacting ATFX.

ATFX Complaints

Since ATFX is a regulated firm, it has a clear complaint-handling procedure. Any complaint is handled thoroughly. This includes a full response as well as an explanation. The staff at ATFX all undergo complaint-handling training. In most cases, ATFX is able to resolve complaints early on.

In the rare case of an unresolved complaint, clients can sometimes refer to the FOS. This independent body has the purpose of investigating complaints made against regulated firms.

As such, Bitsgap has evolved to accommodate the many needs and expectations of cryptocurrency traders.

Bitsgap at a Glance

Contents [Show]

Bitsgap is advertised as a new way to trade across multiple exchanges, by finding the best rates and effectively managing your portfolio. The platform allows you to bring all of these elements under one roof, providing access from a single account at the click of a button. It has carefully designed features that will enable you to:

Quickly compare rates from heaps of digital currency markets
Trade and instantly switch between different exchanges
Keep track of your investments
Basic and advanced order types
Take advantage of the price difference between exchanges using arbitrage
Test your strategies out via a demo account facility without risking any capital

Currently, Bitsgap is integrated with 30 exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, Bitfinex, and more. Traders have access to 10,000+ cryptocurrency trading pairs and several technical indicators available to formulate your strategies. The platform offers an optimised and intuitive interface for both beginners and seasoned traders.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this free trial to understand how the platform works before you opt-in for a paid version.

Basic Plan at $19 a Month

The basic account comes with all standard features and allows you to engage in unlimited exchanges. However, there is a trading limit of $25,000.

You also get access to your cross-exchange portfolio, and can set up trading signals and extended order types. The demo trading option is also available together with two active automated trading bots.

Advanced Plan at $44 a Month

This account gives you all perks of the basic plan, with a $100,000 monthly trading limit. There is also a boost in the number of active trading bots from 2 to 5. In addition, you can also benefit from the Bitsgap arbitrage services.

Pro Plan at $110 a Month

The Pro Plan is most suited for traders who are looking for unlimited limits across unlimited exchanges. You can also set up 15 active bots to trade in live market conditions. Pro Plan owners will also receive priority support.

Note: Bistgap does not charge any fees for any trades. All of its services are included in the monthly subscription fee. Any fees on transactions are imposed by the respective exchange you are trading on.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

Another major plus is the wealth of resources made available on the platform, and the Support Section contains a number of guides, and FAQs that help people get to grips with the most important issues.

Furthermore, the team maintain a blog that details a number of key concepts for newer traders, and also provide further assistance via their Telegram group, YouTube Channel, and other social media channels, and members can gain access to the 3Commas Discord from inside their accounts.

Most importantly, on top of being easy to navigate, and incorporating a range of trading tools, 3Commas is also free to try, and anyone can make use of the free trial to test out the platform and play around with its various features.

What Is Uphold?

Contents [Show]

Uphold describes itself as a “global multi-asset digital trading platform”. Founded back in 2015, it has quickly grown to become one of the major destinations for people looking to take charge of their finances by investing their money.

At this time, the platform is used by people located in over 184 countries, supports over 200 currencies, and provides access to a variety of commodities. This reach has allowed Uphold to power more than $31 billion in transactions ever since being launched over 91 million transactions, a testament to its popularity.

With the mission to be the “center of the digital money revolution”, Uphold is all about making investing as easy as possible for its users. This is why it strives to offer a unique experience through its “anything-to-anything” capabilities, simplifying the investment process beyond what other platforms are capable of.

With Uphold, you can set up an account, verify your identity and buy crypto

Combined with its regulatory compliance and security, its multiasset approach has been one of the main reasons behind its success.

If you are an investor looking to gain access to new commodities markets without having to relearn what your previous endeavors taught you, Uphold might be a good choice for you.

Setting up your Uphold account is easy and painless, multiple funding and withdrawal methods are available, fees are accessible to low-volume investors, and security is top-notch.

However, if you are a frequent trader or plan to have a large portfolio, it might not be the right fit for you.

Uphold Features

Understanding what features are offered by a specific platform will be essential when deciding if it is the right fit for you or not. After all, long-term investors will want to have options such as staking in the case of crypto, allowing them to further profit from their investments.

Fortunately, Uphold is a platform that doesn’t lack in the feature department. Having said that, let’s take a look at the most critical features you will gain when using Uphold.

Desktop, Mobile, and Smartphone App

While this might sound like an unimportant feature, we find it to be extremely relevant in today’s world. Not only has technology changed how we can access our digital services but when it comes to investing, you need to be able to access your portfolio at any time.

Surprisingly, many major trading platforms don’t offer smartphone apps for their users to access their services.

The Uphold Wallet

If you were to find that your platform of choice didn’t have a smartphone app, your first thought would be to access the website from your phone’s browser.

Despite mobile traffic accounting for almost 59% of all internet traffic, many web developers don’t worry about making their code compatible with mobiles. If your portfolio needs immediate attention, having to go through the mess of an incompatible website is the last thing you want.

Be it with Uphold or any other platform, we always recommend making sure you have different means to access its features. This will not only save you headaches in the future but is also a testament to the platform’s readiness, commitment, and capabilities.

Cryptocurrency Exchange

Let’s start by repeating that Uphold has an “anything-to-anything” mentality, which means you can trade any asset for another at any given time. As such, while we will be talking about the different asset types as distinct, they can be exchanged for one another in reality. Having said that, let’s continue.

The Uphold Exchange

Uphold offers an excellent crypto trading platform to its users, supporting some of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the space. This crypto trading platform is available in its desktop, mobile, and Smartphone version, and will allow you to buy, sell, and trade crypto. Unfortunately, the platform only offers limited orders.

This lack of other order types means that advanced crypto traders will be greatly restricted in terms of what they can do. However, if you are a beginner or don’t use any other type of order, this won’t be a limitation at all but will make things easier for you.

Supported Cryptocurrencies

Uphold supports over 190 cryptocurrencies, giving traders of all levels a chance to access the crypto market with the certainty of not missing out on opportunities. These cryptocurrencies include altcoins, emerging tokens, stablecoins, and major currencies.

With the list of supported cryptocurrencies constantly expanding and changing, we recommend that you check the official page for any questions regarding supported currencies.

However, these are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies supported by Uphold:

BTC
XRP
ETH
BAL
BAT
ADA
COMP
ATOM
BCHBTG
DASH
DCR
DGB
DOGE
DOT
EOS
IOTA
Many, many more…
Precious Metals Exchange

Investing in precious metals might not be as popular as investing in equity or cryptocurrency but they remain one of the safest bets due to their tangible nature.

Precious metals are considered one of the best hedge methods there are, which is why most expert investors add them to their portfolios.

If you are interested in investing in precious metals, Uphold is a great option.

At Uphold, buying metals is easy

The platform makes it easy for anyone to invest in them without having to go through the hoops associated with acquiring them physically. This means no storage, transport, or permits have to be something you worry about: Just invest as you would with crypto or stocks!

The precious metals you can buy using Uphold are Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Palladium. Buying them is as easy as any other commodity and you can use any of the currencies or commodities supported by Uphold all thanks to that “anything-to-anything” capabilities!

Stock Exchange

Uphold allows its users to invest in tons of U.S stocks for some of the biggest companies in the world. No matter how expensive a stock is, fractional equities allow them to invest as little as 1 dollar, all while giving you proportional ownership and dividends.

This is the way in which Uphold has helped democratize a market that had historically been accessible to only a few.

U.S. Equities

The benefits of investing in stocks with Uphold are that there is no minimum investment amount, there are no account fees, equity can be sent to other people free of charge, easy funding, and much more.

In addition to this, you won’t have to worry about your favorite company not being available as over 40 stocks are available.

These include:

TSLA
AMZN
AAPL
GOOGL
ADBE
AMD
T
BABA
BA
BRK.B
CSCO
DIS

Just like with the supported cryptocurrencies, this list could change at any given time. As such, we recommend you check the official page for the latest information.

Environmental Assets

Environmental efforts have gained traction over the past decades as politicians, businesses, and everyday people join forces to help the environment. Now, you can join this fight by investing in projects designed to help tackle issues like climate change. Uphold is one of the few platforms allowing investors to do just that at this time.

Environmental assets are a form of Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) in which investors acquire assets like tradable carbon credit tokens and environmentally-conscious commodities.

By doing so, your investment is directly helping the environment either by ensuring no negative impact takes place or actively helping reverse the damage made by other activities.

Uphold only offers two environmental assets at the time of writing: Universal Carbon Tokens (UPCO2) and Bitcoin Zero (BTC0). The former is a crypto token minted through Ethereum which is backed 1:1 by verified carbon units, effectively making it a form of carbon credit.

Bitcoin zero, on the other hand, is a Bitcoin wrapper that has been rendered carbon neutral via UPCO2.

If you want to help the environment while investing, these 2 options are great. Not only are you investing in the underlying projects (Ethereum and Bitcoin) but also in the environmental movement itself. Make sure to check the latest information to be sure what your options are!

Limitless Orders

You might remember we mentioned that Uphold only supports limit orders. Worry not, this is not a mistake. Uphold’s “limitless orders” is a feature of sorts rather than an order type. This feature is one of our favorite things about Uphold as it can be integrated with several investment strategies.

Limitless orders allow users to place up to 50 limit orders at any given time using one pool of capital. What this means is that your funds are not taken away at the moment of creating an order but rather when it is executed.

As such, you no longer have to decide between 2 moves… You can create an order for both and the first one to have its condition met will be executed.

Combine this with Uphold’s “anything-to-anything” and you got yourself a recipe for effective investing. If you are worried about the resulting fees, there is no need. You will only be charged for the transaction that goes through, making it a win-win… All without having to constantly monitor the market.

Staking

Staking is one of the most popular and powerful tools available to crypto investors, allowing them to generate additional rewards. Staking has been possible since the inception of the “proof of stake” protocol in the blockchain world, becoming a major staple ever since.

When a user stakes its cryptocurrency, it is helping the blockchain network become more efficient and secure by improving the transaction verification process. As a result, the user starts generating rewards that come in the form of cryptocurrency most of the time.

Staking

The best part about it is that users don’t really need to do much after staking, just wait. This makes this feature incredibly useful for long-term investors.

Most of the dominant blockchain networks support staking at this time, with the exception of Ethereum and Bitcoin at the time of writing. However, Ethereum is working on making a shift that would allow users to stake their Ether. At this time,

Uphold supports staking for the following cryptocurrencies:

Kava (KAVA)
Kusama (KSM)
Polkadot (DOT)
Cosmos (ATOM)
Mina (MINA)
Polygon (MATIC)
Solana (SOL)
Tron (TRX)
Flow (FLOW)
Ethereum (ETH)
Tezos (XTZ)
Cardano (ADA)
Algorand (ALGO)

As usual, make sure to check the latest information to know all the options at any given time.

Automated Trading

Also known as AutoPilot, this feature allows you to automate your investing by setting up regular transactions, be it selling or buying. This is great for people using strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging as it will take all the work away from you.

This feature can be used to invest in all of the commodities supported by Uphold, as well as using them as payment methods. If you would rather use a debit card to fund your purchases, this is also possible.

Uphold Fees

While you won’t need to open an Uphold account, there are fees associated with some of the services like buying and selling.

This is the same model used by most investment platforms but with the main difference: Fees are locked pre-trade. This means you won’t have nasty surprises when executing orders.

Let’s start by talking about the fees you won’t be paying. These are deposit and withdrawal fees, as well as trading commissions. These are nonexistent.

The feelings you will need to pay attention to are “spreads”. This will differ for cryptocurrencies (depending on which one you are transacting with) and fiat currencies. In the case of crypto, buy spread fees can be between 1.25% and 0.95% while the sell spread will fall between 1.25% and 1.1%. In the case of fiat, the buy spread will be between 0.05% and 0.2% for buy and sell spreads.

You can find the latest information on fees here. As this can change at any time, we recommend you check them before using the platform. However, you will see how much you will incur in fees before completing a transaction as a result of Uphold commitment to transparency.

Uphold Customer Support

Customer support is just as important as features. Fortunately, Uphold is known for having one of the best customer support teams in the space. However, chances are that you won’t be needing them as the platform is extremely intuitive and easy to use.

In addition to this, Uphold offers resources like a Cryptionary, Blog, FAQ, Help Center, System status, and get started sections that do their job pretty well. You can also submit a request via the help center.

While Uphold doesn’t offer support via phone or chat, tickets are replied to in a timely manner. That being said, it is important to clarify that this was our personalñ experience with the customer support team.

Platforms like Trustpilot give Uphold a 2.5 rating, which is considered poor. As such, we recommend you give a look at some good and bad reviews and judge by yourself!

Is Uphold secure?

Uphold complies with all regulations required by the United States. Not only is all of its data encrypted but all security patches and systems are constantly monitored, pen-testing and auditing are regularly taking place, and access to the servers is closely regulated.

Over its more than 7 years of existence, Uphold has not been involved in any data leak or breach. This is not only due to the measures the team takes to protect data on its end but also to the platform offering 2-factor authentication and other features that increase security on the user’s end.

Conclusion

Uphold is one of the most solid choices for any user looking to invest, especially if you are looking to be exposed to several types of commodities. Its ease of use, top-notch security, high transparency when it comes to fees, and great accessibility make it a great option.

That being said, if you are looking for diverse order types or advanced features, you might want to look elsewhere. Popular features like loaning, debit/credit card issuing, advanced charting, and social trading are not supported.

The localized tax reports also come in handy and error reconciliation features such as auto balance verification, and negative balance warnings help anyone not too familiar with doing their taxes.

These features combine to provide a more bespoke service that would suit high frequency traders while the free plan lets less active enthusiasts to easily keep track of all their accounts.

Conclusion

With that said, seasoned traders will often make use of several exchanges to access specific markets and pairs, or take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. Moving from exchange to exchange can, however, be both cumbersome and time-consuming.

With that in mind, Bitsgap makes it possible for you to connect all your exchanges in one place. This comes with a plethora of plus-points – such as being able to execute arbitrage strategies with ease and deploy advanced bots to trade simultaneously across multiple platforms.

As such, Bitsgap has evolved to accommodate the many needs and expectations of cryptocurrency traders.

In this Bitsgap review, we explore everything there is to know about the cross-exchange services offered by the provider.

Traders have access to 10,000+ cryptocurrency trading pairs and several technical indicators available to formulate your strategies. The platform offers an optimised and intuitive interface for both beginners and seasoned traders.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds

How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this free trial to understand how the platform works before you opt-in for a paid version.

Basic Plan at $19 a Month

The basic account comes with all standard features and allows you to engage in unlimited exchanges. However, there is a trading limit of $25,000.

You also get access to your cross-exchange portfolio, and can set up trading signals and extended order types. The demo trading option is also available together with two active automated trading bots.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

"The Best Torrent Sites: Complete Guide to The Most Popular Sites","Torrents are files containing metadata, which is a data set containing information on other data. Therefore, a torrent does contain…","Torrents are files containing metadata, which is a data set containing information on other data. Therefore, a torrent does contain the content file. Instead, it helps torrent software search for “peers” or “seeds” that share the data. The program then extracts data from those shared files, producing a finished version of the data.

Think of it as using the torrent software to collect whatever movies, TV shows, music, or other content files you want from other people’s computers all around the world. That doesn’t mean that you need to give up your drive and all your information when you download a torrent, either.

The program collects pieces of data from shared files and puts them together on your computer or device. No-one has access to your information at any stage. The speed of the data transfer depends on the number of peers hosting the content for transfer. The seeds or peers, the faster the data transfer.

How Does a Torrent Work?

Contents [Show]

When you browse online, the browser sends multiple requests to servers every second to download information related to your browsing session. If the server can’t handle the request load from users on its network, it ends up crashing.

When browsing, the browser in use sends multiple requests to a server so that it can download the information.

However, this server can have too much traffic from users who are trying to access the same information. As a result, the servers crash, and everyone on the network loses their connection. Torrents work on “Peer-to-Peer” technology described above, by transferring data between systems. However, with P2P transfers, it’s possible to move large volumes of data on a platform, without experiencing any difficulties of overloading servers and networks. P2P transfers can occur on the BitTorrent protocol, a system used to transfer files online.

How BitTorrent Works

By installing a BitTorrent client on your device or computer, you can access these P2P networks, allowing you to download torrent files that contain all your favorite entertainment. You capture small pieces of information from all the seeds on the system, piecing together the data to allow you to host it on your device or PC.

The trackers in the torrent file make it easy for the protocol to identify the relevant data in the transfer, recording the number of seeds for the torrent file, as well as the total downloads, file size, and peers seeding the file.

“Leeching” describes a practice where people download the torrent file from the network, but don’t leave their connection available after to seed the data back to the system. The community frowns on this process, so if you have unlimited bandwidth available, consider giving back to the community some time.

BitTorrent, the company, was purchased by Justin Sun, Creator of the Tron Blockchain platform in 2018.

Disclaimer

While the BitTorrent protocol is entirely legal, the unapproved use of the software to download and distribute copyrighted content is illegal. The regulators are in a constant battle with torrent sites, with torrenters trying to prove that the use of trackers and BitTorrent metafiles don’t store any file contents.

Regulators will always be in a struggle with torrenting sites. Some sites have harder times with the authorities than others. However, it’s best to ensure that you remain anonymous online when using a torrent service.

Download and install a VPN for your device or laptop before you start downloading. Use a VPN when downloading. This tool safeguards you against any malicious activity from bad actors or third-party software while you’re surfing the web and downloading files.

The purpose of this article is for information purposes only. We are in no way suggesting that you use the information in this article to download copywritten material.

The Top 25 Torrent Sites

In this section, we’ll bring you some information on the best public trackers available. Most of the options in this review offer you a safe means of downloading torrents. However, remember to use a VPN and ensure that your internet security is tight before you attempt any downloads.

The Pirate Bay
Year Founded: 2003
Monthly active users: 106.08-million
Global Site Rank: 209

The Pirate Bay is the most infamous torrent site on the internet. This site got plenty of attention from Federal authorities, with law enforcement taking down many previous domains. However, you can’t suppress freedom for too long, and the Pirate Bay kept on popping up on different domains.

TPB is your one-stop torrent shop where everything is available for free. Movies, series, Blu-ray, HD 1080p, whatever you want – it’s all there, and it’s all for free. There are millions of torrents on the site. While a vast majority of them are porn, there’s still plenty of useful programs, applications, e-books, movies, series, and documentaries.

The Pirate Bay is a free site, and it doesn’t cost you anything to download, but tipping the developers through the Bitcoin or Monero crypto network is an excellent way to give back. You’ll find the wallet addresses for the community at the footer of the page.

This site features many millions of visitors every month. Still, it’s probably a lot more than the registered traffic, as plenty of the users utilize proxies, VPNs, or mirrors to gain safe access to The Pirate Bay. Alexa ranks TPB as the 209th most visited site online, but we bet it’s really in the top 100, at least.

Visit

YTS
Year Founded: 2010
Monthly active users: 118.6-million
Global Site Rank: 182

TPB is a popular site, but there are reports of it not being a safe place to download your torrents. Our top choice for the safest site with the best selection goes to YTS.am. YTS arrived to fill the gap left by the Motion Picture Association of America when it shut down YIFY, the predecessor to YTS.

YTS has all the latest releases, in varying levels of quality. HD and Blu-ray titles are available, and the user interface is easy to navigate. The search is functional, and you can find any old movie you want in the platform’s extensive archives.

Alexa ranks YTS as the 182nd most popular site online, with nearly 120-million unique visitors to the platform every month.

Rutracker
Year Founded: 2004
Monthly active users: 85.74-million
Global Site Rank: 256

Rutracker is one of the lesser-know torrenting websites. It’s popular in Russia but doesn’t get a lot of traction anywhere else in the world. It might surprise you to learn that Russia has its version of just about every western digital service. Gmail is Rumail, and the Pirate Bay is Rutracker.

Rutracker indexes everything in Russian, so unless you can speak the language, you’re going to have a tough time navigating your way through the site. You get a wide selection of torrents, including music, e-books, software, movies, and series.

It’s also strange to think that the Russian government banned and blocked the site in 2015, showing the average Russian’s ability to circumvent international cybersecurity laws using tools like a virtual private network (VPN).

According to Alexa, Rutracker ranks as the 256th most popular site online.

KickAssTorrents, otherwise known as KAT, was an example of how far the government is willing to go to allocate resources to protecting copyright. The US Department of Justice seized the original kat.cr website that was almost as big as Pirate Bay at the time.

In a miscarriage of justice in the fight against information freedom, the US prosecuted the owner of the website. However, proving once again that you can’t lock up the freedom of information, the site appeared under a new URL, katcr.co.

The new site features a vast library of torrents. Browse through the subcategories and choose your favorite movies, anime, TV shows, games, e-books, applications, software, and music. This site has an excellent interface that’s simple to use, and an elegant design that’s easy on the eyes.

Year Founded: 2012

Magnet files are an excellent choice for identifying the content in files using cryptographic hashing, instead of the actual location of the file. As a result, anyone can create a file, with no central authority needing to provide issuance.

If you want to download magnet links, then you’ll need to have a BitTorrent client downloaded and installed on your computer. Qbittorent and uTorrent are some of the more popular choices for a BitTorrent client that can download magnet links.

The interface of the site has a minimalist feel, and after conducting the research, the site offers users the chance to download the file or stream it online.

Before the use of torrents for distributed peers, trackers were the only method of locating peers with content to share online. The usage of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) by BitTorrent clients helps to find peers for the file via a BitTorrent protocol. This system offers a means of distributing tracking, gaining significant popularity thanks to its decentralized approach of file transfers.

BTDigg relies on the use of DHT protocols for file searches, and the site itself provides a clean and user-friendly interface. The website collects metadata for the DHT network, and one of the key advantages is that no torrents are involved in the running of the site, and there is no content on the site’s servers.

Your search results display torrent-related information, such as the size, name, age, and the number of files. The listing also provides a single link for execution with your BitTorrent client.

What are the Advantages of Downloading Torrent?

There are plenty of advantages to using torrent downloads. The first reason is the entertainment on tap, there no need to pay for streaming services when you can download torrents for free.

You also get a better range of media on torrent sites. For instance, on the Pirate Bay, you can find movies, TV shows, series, documentaries, e-books, video games, software programs, and anime. That kind of selection isn’t available on any streaming site, and you’ll need multiple subscriptions to handle that kind of action.

With torrent files, you also get to keep the files. That’s especially important when you’re dealing with software programs and e-books. Transferring data in a P2P manner also benefits business.

It’s for this reason that many companies that handle large volumes of data now integrate P2P solutions in systems to save on bandwidth and server storage space.

Are There Any Disadvantages in Downloading Torrent Files?

As you can see, there are plenty of advantages to using P2P file transfers. Torrents are handy ways to share information, but there are also risks and limitations associated with handling torrents.

For instance, access to secured files is easy to manage through servers, but it’s far more challenging with torrents. The backup files on the server also assure that it’s easy to restore files if the central hub shuts down.

Downloading torrents can also consume plenty of bandwidth. If you’re working on a limited data plan, then make sure you check your consumption. If you decide to seed back to the network, then you’ll also be using bandwidth for this process.

Do I Need a VPN to Download Torrents?

No, you don’t need to have a VPN if you want to download torrents online – but you should. There are thousands of stories about how torrent sites can damage your data and your machine.

Countless stories are floating around online, from installing viruses and malware in torrents downloaded to computers, to identity theft and extortion. The internet is a wild place, and you need protection to keep your identity and data safe while downloading torrents.

Using these sites without the assistance of a VPN is like walking down the road naked. Everyone starts paying attention to you, and some people might want to come in for a closer look. If they think you have something of value to offer them, they might decide to rob you.

However, being robbed online isn’t the same as in the real world. If some thug sticks you up in an alleyway with a knife, you know that someone robbed you.

However, online, you won’t even realize it happened until you get a call from the credit agencies saying you suddenly are outstanding with a large loan payment you never knew existed.

Identity theft and fraud online is a real thing, and you need to protect yourself and your computer from any online threats that could cost you your livelihood.

Which VPN to use?

We have reviewed a number of VPNs, as follows:

Avast VPN
Express VPN
Nord VPN
CyberGhost VPN
AVG VPN
Pure VPN
How Does a VPN Work?

A VPN is a third-party software available from numerous providers. After downloading and installing the software on your machine, you open a user dashboard.

On your dash, you’ll see servers listed in various countries, such as the USA and UK. By clicking onto one of these servers, you route your connection to the internet through the proxy addresses used by the VPN. As a result, your ISP and hackers can’t see you online; essentially – you’re invisible.

Therefore, with a VPN, you don’t have to worry about anyone discovering your IP address. You also don’t have any concerns about someone accessing your machine remotely through a virus. A VPN offers you the safest means of downloading torrents.

How do I Download a Torrent?

Downloading a torrent is easy. All you need to do is download a torrent client, install it on your device or PC. After its running, log in to any of the sites mentioned in this review.

Follow this step-by-step process for downloading your first torrent file.

Step 1 – Download a torrent client like uTorrent or qbittorrent from an official website.
Step 2 – Search the torrent site for your media file
Step 3 – Click the magnet icon on the file you want to download
Step 4 – Select the path or drive to save the file on your device or PC
Step 5 – Click OK, and start your download

NOTE: Priority will always go to the first file that starts downloading when working with simultaneous downloads or multiple files.

Using torrents to access your favorite media, software, and internet tools is a great way to stay entertained while stuck indoors.

As long as you have an internet connection or Wi-Fi, you can always download torrents.

What are the Types of Torrent Sites?

We can categorize torrent sites into private and public venues. Public torrent sites, also known as “open trackers,” will permit access to any user when accessing the tracker address. Fortunately, downloading files from these platforms is a straightforward process.

Private torrent sites, otherwise known as private trackers, will limit access to members. In most cases, members are only able to register through invite-only. Existing members must approve permission for new members to access the platform and issue an entrance code via email.

Private sites may also require members to meet specific seeding goals to keep the network alive.

Public trackers offer you the best option for ease of use. These platforms are open, so the chance of downloading a bad piece of software or malware is a risk you’ll have to learn to mitigate if you want to continue to download torrents.

The advantage of private trackers is that the members all experience a vetting process before joining the network. Therefore, there is much less risk of a malicious software ending up in your torrent transfer.","https://blockonomi.com/best-torrent-sites/"

The global exchange and third-party broker is home to some of the largest trading volumes in the space, alongside a fee-structure that should suit most budgets.

In this guide, we review the ins and outs of KuCoin. This includes an in-depth look at the platform’s supported coins, fiat currency facilities, fees and commissions, safety, customer support, and trading arena.

What is KuCoin?

Contents [Show]

Launched as recently as 2017, KuCoin is a cryptocurrency exchange that also offers third-party brokerage services. Although the platform has just three years of trading history, it is now one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the space.

One of the main reasons for this is that you will find over 200 coins with about 450 cryptocurrency pairs hosted at the exchange. Not only does this include major pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, but heaps of crypto-cross pairs. Best of all, if you have an appetite to trade a less liquid ERC-20 token, chances are you will find it at KuCoin.

Kucoin Homepage

KuCoin was initially a cryptocurrency-only platform, meaning that you could not deposit funds with fiat currency. However, the platform has since formed a partnership with Simplex – a European payment provider that bridges the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday money.

When it comes to cryptocurrency trading fees, KuCoin charges just 0.10%. This puts it on par with the likes of Binance. Similarly, KuCoin is also behind its own digital token – KuCoin Shares (KCS). By owning and storing KCS tokens, you will benefit from discounted trading fees, as well as an entitlement to a share of the trading commissions that KuCoin collects.

In terms of the numbers, KuCoin claims to have facilitated more than 650 million individual trades since its inception in 2017. This translates to more than $71 billion in accumulated trading volumes.

Finally – and as we cover in more detail further down, KuCoin is not regulated by a national licensing body. Although this means that you will be able to trade cryptocurrencies without supplying any ID, this won’t be the case if you wish to buy digital coins with a debit/credit card through Simplex.

What can you Trade at KuCoin?

KuCoin offers a vast range of financial instruments that goes above and beyond just crypto-to-crypto pairs. On the contrary, the platform also offers cryptocurrency indexes, margin trading, and even futures.

Let’s explore each asset class in more detail.

Crypto-to-Crypto Pairs

Each and every trading pair at KuCoin falls within the remit of crypto-to-crypto, not least because it does not offer any fiat-denominated instruments. Instead, you will need to trade your chosen cryptocurrency against the USDT if you want access to the crypto-to-USD space.

If you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency trader then you will know first hand that this is industry standard anyway, so you’ll have no issues with trading volumes or liquidity.

Outside of USDT, you can trade crypto-cross pairs. Examples of this include BTC/ETH, ETH/XRP, and BSC/BTC. Ultimately, listing each and every trading digital currency is beyond the remit of this review, albeit, rest assured that the platform hosts more than 450 pairs.

Some of the Kucoin markets

Crucially, KuCoin is often one of the very first exchanges that newly launched cryptocurrency token projects opt for. As such, support for less liquid digital tokens is something that the team at KuCoin actively look to facilitate.

For a full breakdown of each and every pair that KuCoin hosts, you can find this information here at CoinMarketCap.

KuCoin Indexes

On top of traditional crypto-cross pairs, KuCoin also offers a number of indexes. The concept here is that KuCoin will take the weighted average of a specific cryptocurrency across several leading exchanges.

This is with the view of offering a more accurate price of the coin in question, as it takes into account the variations that you often find between competing platforms.

KuCoin indexes are available across:

Bitcoin
Ethereum
Ripple
Litecoin

The cryptocurrency exchanges that KuCoin derives its pricing activity from are:

Coinbase
Bitstamp
Kraken
Gemini
Bittrex
Liquid

The price of each index is denominated in USD, but settled in the respective cryptocurrency.

KuCoin Futures

Launched in mid-2019, the KuCoin Mercantile Exchange allows you to trade Bitcoin futures. KuCoin itself notes that it is looking to challenge the likes of BitMEX in this particular area of the cryptocurrency derivative space. As a result, you will have access to Bitcoin futures alongside a substantial margin position of up to 100x.

In simple terms, this means that a $100 account balance would permit a maximum trade value of $10,000. When it comes to the underlying spot price, KuCoin once again takes the weighted average from various leading exchanges – such as Kraken, Coinbase Pro, and Bitstamp.

Kucoin Futures

At the time of writing, KuCoin only supports BTC and ETH futures, although it hopes to add further digital currencies in the near future. When it comes to fees, expect to pay 0.060% as a market taker, and 0.020% as a maker. There are also settlement fees of 0.025%.

Trading Fees and Commissions

First and foremost, there are no fees associated with cryptocurrency deposits, and withdrawals are charged at the standard mining rate as per the coin you are looking to cash out.

When it comes to trading fees outside of the futures arena, you will pay 0.1%. This means that a $10,000 trade would cost you $10 in fees. As we briefly mentioned earlier, this sits in-line with fellow exchange counterpart Binance.

KuCoin Shares (KCS)

KuCoin Shares – or simply KCS, is a proprietary cryptocurrency token created by the exchange. By owning and holding KCS tokens you will be accustomed to a number of benefits.

This includes:

Discounted Trading Fees

One of the most notable benefits of holding KuCoin Shares is that you will get discounted trading fees. Crucially, while a standard fee of 0.1% is industry-leading, you stand the potential to reduce this by an additional 20%. What you need to do is to simply turn on the KCS Pay Fee button and enjoy the discount.

Dividends

On top of reducing your trading commissions, holding an allocation of KuCoin Shares affords you the opportunity to earn dividends. In a nutshell, KuCoin as a platform will distribute 50% of the trading commissions that it collects from members each and every day.

This is then distributed proportionately across all holders of KuCoin Shares. For example, let’s suppose that you hold 1% of the entire KCS supply. If the platform pays out $250,000 in commissions, you would receive $2,500. You need to hold at least 6 KCS to benefit from the dividends.

Price History and Buying KuCoin Shares

To say the value of KuCoin Shares has capitulated since its all-time highs of January 2018 would be an understatement. At a peak of over $20 each, you can now obtain the very same tokens for less than $1 in mid-2020.

Nevertheless, if you do want to get your hands on KuCoin Shares you can do this by exchanging them at the platform for an alternative cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Fiat Currency Facilities at KuCoin

As the end of 2018, KuCoin has since formed a partnership with European-based payment provider Simplex. The partnership ensures that users from over 100 countries can now deposit real-world funds with a debit or credit card.

This is ideal if you are looking to trade cryptocurrencies, futures at KuCoin but you do not have any digital currencies available to you. Instead, you can simply enter your debit/credit card details and get cash directly into the platform.

Purchase crypto with credit card

With that being said, it is important to note that the fees associated with this are not cheap. Although the occasional promotion is offered on deposit fees, this will cost you a whopping 2.5 – 3.5% (with a $10 minimum).

This means that a $1000 debit/credit card deposit would cost you $25 in fees. It is noticed that this is slightly cheaper than the likes of Coinbase, which charges 3.99% (with various minimums in place).

Also, KuCoin is developing an OTC Trading Desk, on which all users could buy and sell major coins like BTC, USDT, PAX without any fee. The OTC platform currently supports USD, CAD, CNY, IDR and VND.

Trading Platforms

KuCoin offers a proprietary trading platform that was built from the ground-up. There is no requirement to download or install any software to your desktop device, as the KuCoin trading arena can be accessed through your standard web browser. The platform is potentially suited to both newbie investors and seasoned traders.

The reason we say this is that while the platform is super-clean and easy to navigate through, there are heaps of advanced tools available at your disposal. In fact, you have the ability to fully customize your KuCoin trading screen however you see fit.

Kucoin Trading Screen

When it comes to trading volumes and the availability of liquidity, you should have no concerns at all when trading more popular pairs. You might, however, find that volumes are low on less liquid pairs – especially those involving ERC-20 tokens.

Mobile Trading

If you have a tendency to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies on the move, then you might be interested in the KuCoin mobile trading app.

The application is available to download on iOS and Android devices. You will have access to most account features on the app, such as placing orders, checking the value of your portfolio, and depositing and withdrawing funds.

How Long do Withdrawals Take at KuCoin?

In the vast majority of cases, KuCoin will process your withdrawals within 30 minutes of receiving the request. The platform notes that this is automated, and that manual authorization is only required if the size of your deposit is larger than 100,000 times that of the handling fee (mining fee).

Once the funds leave KuCoin, they will be transferred to the cryptocurrency wallet address of your choosing. Make sure that the address is valid, as there is nothing that KuCoin can do if you make an error!

Kucoin Withdrawals
Earn Interest at KuCoin

An additional feature available at KuCoin is that of its lending program. In its most basic form, you stand the chance of earning interest on your digital currency holdings by loaning it out. The main concept is that the tokens will be used to help fund margin accounts.

For example, let’s suppose that a KuCoin trader decides to apply leverage of 10x on an order. For each day that the position is kept open overnight, the trader would need to pay interest. This is because they are trading with more than they have in their account and thus – this comes at a cost.

Earn interest lending your cryptocurrency

With that said, KuCoin has opened its doors to everyday investors by giving you the opportunity to fund margin positions. This is available on several coins – including USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and many more.

In terms of the specific interest rate, this will vary from coin to coin. As an example, by lending out Bitcoin for 28 days, you could be earning an annualized interest rate of 4.83%.

If this is something that you are interested in exploring, KuCoin offers a profit estimation calculator. You simply need to specify how much you are willing to lend out, on what digital currency, and for what length of time – and the calculator will advise you how much you can earn.

It is important to remember that although the rates of interest on offer are super-competitive, you must consider the risks associated with this. After all, KuCoin is not a regulated cryptocurrency exchange so you must factor this into your risk vs reward model.

Is KuCoin Safe?

As is the case with all cryptocurrency exchanges, it is crucial that you are able to ascertain whether or not KuCoin is safe. Not only does this include the platform’s regulatory standing, but its internal and external security practices, too.

Let’s break these metrics down in more detail.

Regulation

In a nutshell, KuCoin is not regulated by any national licensing bodies. This isn’t a major surprise in the cryptocurrency exchange arena, as lots of platforms choose to operate without a license. Whether or not you feel comfortable trading at an unregulated exchange depends on what side of the fence you sit on.

For example, if you are the type of trader that prefers to buy and sell cryptocurrency pairs in an anonymous nature, then there is every chance that a platform like KuCoin is suitable for your needs. At the other end of the spectrum, if you are the type of trader that demands a regulatory safeguard of some sort, then KuCoin might not suffice.

KYC

As noted above, KuCoin is not required to ask you for any personal information – nor will they demand sensitive identity documents. However, the one exception to this rule is if you plan to deposit funds with a debit or credit card through the Simplex integration.

In fact, in order to remain compliant with all relevant laws surrounding anti-money laundering, you will need to upload a copy of your government-issued ID (passport or driver’s license). This is just the nature of the game when using fiat currency at a crypto-exchange.

KuCoin Security Practices

In terms of internal security practices, KuCoin claims to run institutional-grade systems that ensures it keeps crime away from the platform. This is fully supported by a commitment to cold storage.

Although the exact percentage is not specified by KuCoin, it is claimed that the vast bulk of client funds are held offline. The remainder is kept in hot wallets to ensure the platform is able to meet its offering of near-instant and automated withdrawals.

To date, there have been no publications of KuCoin encountering a major hack of any sort, which is an excellent sign. With that said, you always need to ensure you understand the risks of a potential external hack, as your funds are being stored in wallets that you do not personally control.

Also, it is worth noting that in April 2020, KuCoin completed a strategic cooperation with Onchain Custodian, Singapore’s crypto asset custody platform. Onchain Custodian will offer custody service for the safekeeping of KuCoin crypto assets. The custodial funds will be backed by Lockton, the world’s largest private insurance brokerage company. This is believed to further enhance the exchange’s security level.

2FA

Best of all, KuCoin allows you to install two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account. This means that a unique code will be sent to your mobile device whenever you wish to perform key account functions. This includes logging into your account and making a withdrawal request.

KuCoin Customer Support

When it comes to customer service, the team at KuCoin provides an around the clock support team that operates 24 hours per day – 7 days per week. You can send the team an email, albeit, if you need instant one-on-one support you are best advised to use the live chat facility.

Kucoin Customer Support

Sentiment on this is somewhat mixed in the public domain. With some users reporting connection times in the seconds, others have noted that waiting times are beyond acceptable. With that said, it all depends on how busy the team is at the time of the request. There is no telephone support service offered.

How to get Started at KuCoin

Like the sound of KuCoin and think the platform is suitable for your long-term trading needs? If so, we are now going to show you what you need to do to get started with a trading account today.

Step 1: Open an Account

To get the ball rolling, head over to the KuCoin homepage and click on the ‘Sign Up’ button at the top of the screen. You will then be prompted to enter your email address and to choose a strong password.

You will need to verify your email address before linking up 2FA via your mobile phone. At this stage of the registration process, you will not be asked for any personal information.

Kucoin Signup
Step 2: Deposit Funds

Once you have opened your KuCoin account you will then be promoted to deposit some funds. In this respect, you have two options. If you already possess a digital token, you can deposit this straight into KuCoin.

Simply head over to the deposit page and search for the respective coin. Then, click on the deposit tab to reveal your unique wallet address for that specific cryptocurrency.

Copy the address to your clipboard, head over to your private wallet, specify the number of coins you wish to deposit, and confirm the transaction.

Depending on the cryptocurrency you are depositing, it typically takes around 10-20 minutes for the funds to be credited into your KuCoin account.

Fiat Currency Deposit

If you do not have access to a digital currency, you will need to deposit funds with your debit or credit card. Hover over the ‘Buy Crypto’ button and then click on ‘Buy with Credit Card’.

Follow the step-by-step instructions that are presented to you on screen. Crucially, you will be asked to verify your identity before you are able to use your debit/credit card. The end-to-end process is taken care of by Simplex.

Step 3: Start Trading

As soon as your KuCoin account has been funded, you are ready to start trading. The specific trading arena that you need will depend on the type of financial instrument you are looking to access. This is because KuCoin separates its cryptocurrency exchange and future derivative platforms.

KuCoin Review: The Verdict?

In summary, it is clear to see why KuCoin is now one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the space. Not only does it give you access to over 450 cryptocurrency pairs, but you can also trade crypto-specific indexes and Bitcoin futures.

Moreover, standard trading fees amount to just 0.1%, which you can reduce by an additional 20% by paying fee with KuCoin Shares. We also like the fact that you can now deposit funds with a debit or credit card, albeit, you will need to bypass a KYC process first.

The main gripe that we have with KuCoin is that it is not a regulated entity. While this does mean that you can trade crypto-to-crypto pairs anonymously, your funds are never 100% safe.

On the flip side, reports about a KuCoin hack are yet to surface since its inception in 2017 – which is an excellent sign.

"AVG VPN Review: Not The Best Provider, Slow Speeds & Will Share Your Logs","Our VPN reviews are here to help you make an informed decision before committing to a service provider. We review…","Our VPN reviews are here to help you make an informed decision before committing to a service provider. We review all of the top VPN providers to find out who has the better offering. If you’re in the market for online protection, then we have a comprehensive list of VPN providers. We measure all of our reviews using the key metrics of pricing, performance, security, privacy, support, and features.

In this review, we take a look at AVG Secure VPN. Considering we used AVG free anti-virus in the past with excellent result, we were expecting big things from AVG with the release of this software. Read on to see how AVG measures up to the competition.

Visit AVG VPN

AVG VPN

Contents [Show]

Before the rise of Microsoft Security Essentials, AVG anti-virus was the most popular free security software on the internet. Everyone used AVG free in the early days of the internet, and it’s still around today.

With demand for its anti-virus products lagging behind other industry leaders, it appears that the management team at AVG are intent on diversifying their strategy into other related security products.

As a result, we have the launch of AVG VPN, a product designed to protect your online activities.

We have to say that we were excited to give this software a try, but after installing the client and reviewing the features, we were a bit disappointed. After analyzing the performance, things were not looking good for AVG.

Let’s unpack AVG Secure VPN and review it piece by piece.

AVG Secure VPN Pricing

We start with the pricing. While AVG free anti-virus didn’t cost a cent to download, install, and use – AVG Secure VPN it a different animal. The company charge for this product and they are not afraid to drop a hefty price tag on their product. Perhaps the company thought that their reputation in the market allows them to enter at a premium price level.

AVG adopt a different pricing structure to other VPN providers. AVG offers all the features of their VPN to their customers, regardless of the subscription they choose. There is no monthly or quarterly option on the VPN, with only annual plans available. AVG offers you a discount model if you decide to choose a 2-year or 3-year subscription to the service.

Your monthly cost for the software equates to $6.66 a month if you choose the annual plan, and AVG discounts the rate to $6.11 per month on the 3-year plan. We like the fact that they offer the VPN on a free 30-day trial, and your purchase comes backed with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

We also enjoyed that the free trial asked us for no personal information; we click on the download button and execute the file to run the program. After the trial period expires, AVG cancels your service if you don’t take a subscription.

Be careful of your data consumption while using the free version. AVG put a 10GB cap on your downloads for the free trial, and we imagine that many users will burn through this on the first day. If you exceed the limit, then you no longer qualify for the money-back guarantee on your purchase of the software.

AVG also revokes your money-back guarantee if you log onto the internet more than 100-times using the VPN. We found this a sneaky marketing tactic, as most other VPN providers don’t mention these types of restrictions in their “no questions asked” refund policies.

The pricing for AVG Secure VPN is as follows;

3-Years US$6.11 per month.
2-Years US$6.24 per month.
1-year US$6.66 per month.

It’s also important to note that AVG charges for the entire subscription fee upfront. Considering that the pricing is higher than many other premium VPNs, such as Nord VPN or Private Internet Access, this puts AVG on the back foot from the get-go. We hope that the performance of this product justifies the price tag.

Payment Options

It seems that from the moment you commit to purchase AVG Secure VPN, that where everything starts to go wrong. After pulling us through to the payment page, we find that AVG only offers payment for their software with a credit card or PayPal. Now while that suits us fine, we imagine that international customers would like to see alternative payment options like WorldPay, AliPay or Cryptocurrency.

Also, when we contacted one of our friends in Africa, they said that they only had the option to pay with a credit card, and PayPal was not available.

We would like to see the inclusion of more payment systems, as it gives us confidence in the fact that there is demand for the product in emerging markets, meaning that their servers must have a global footprint, and the service works well all over the globe.

Cryptocurrency payments are not available through AVG, which is a pity – especially since we think this payment method is a favorite among people who take online security seriously.

AVG Secure VPN Refund Policy

Most VPN providers offer a free trial of their software, or they issue you with a money-back guarantee with your purchase. AVG decided to do both.

Provided you comply with the rules of the refund, (less than 10GB or downloads, and fewer than 100-session logins,) then you qualify for a refund at any stage of the 30-day guarantee period.

We found the refund process to be painless, and all we needed to do was email the support desk with our refund request.

The company did not send us through customer retention, and they issued the refund the same day. The money returned to our credit card account in 8-business days after receiving the refund receipt.

Headquartered in the Czech Republic – A Data Safe Haven

The “14-Eyes,” is a collaborative effort between the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., and mainland Europe. The project has the goal of surveilling all internet data. If you select a VPN provider within the jurisdiction of the 14-Eyes, then you run the risk of the government picking up on your data usage and browsing history.

In this case, using a VPN residing within the 14-Eyes jurisdiction is a waste of time – it goes against what you are using a VPN for in the first place. Therefore, if you want to remain secure and anonymous in your online activities, you need to choose a VPN provider that resides out of the watchful stare of the 14-Eyes.

Fortunately, AVG Secure VPN has its headquarters in the Czech Republic, away from the 14-eyes jurisdiction. This location gives AVG management the right to refuse to co-operate with any government subpoena for data logs on the company’s users.

Privacy Policy and Data Collection

AVG Secure VPN claim that they have a “no-logs” policy. This statement means that they do not record what you do online with their VPN product. This policy is a key criterion for a VPN, and many users trust their service provider to keep their activities private and secure.

However, AVG does mention that if they receive reports of abuse, they will investigate the claim. The company also claims that they do not allow their customers to use the VPN service to share or distribute pirated content. This clause is pretty standard for the course, but we don’t see this type of language in the terms and conditions of many other VPN providers.

What caught our attention was when we read through the privacy policy for all AVG products, including the VPN service.

It turns out that AVG is collecting a substantial amount of data on its users, and storing them in their servers. Email addresses, phone numbers, SIM card numbers, location data, and your I.P. address are a few examples of the account data accessed by AVG, which can identify you online.

AVG state that they also have the right to share your data with interested third parties, and this includes handing over your session logs to law enforcement if they subpoena the company.

We can’t accept these terms of service, and we find it appalling that AVG would promote their product without clearly informing their customers of these terms. Essentially, there is very little protection on offer from the company, and they will hang you out to dry if the 14-Eyes demand it to be so.

AVG is part of the Avast Group, with headquarters in Amsterdam. Their senior management comprises of U.S. citizens, and we don’t see any reason for them to avoid requests from the 14-Eyes.

User-Interface

We enjoy using apps with clean interfaces – there’s nothing worse than opening an app to a cluttered dashboard; that’s why we appreciate apps with clean interfaces. However, saying that AVG Secure VPN has a clean c-panel would be an understatement.

The AVG Secure VPN dash has very few features. The only data available on the main screen is your server location and connection status. Call us picky – but we would like to see other features like our current I.P. address and connection speed.

Considering the bare-bones nature of the main screen, we are surprised to see that it takes up so much space when we open the desktop client. The main screen gives you access to the list of server locations by clicking the “change location” button, which opens the server list in a separate window.

We enjoyed the look and feel of the server lists, as AVG have all of their locations listed by continent, making it easy to select your ideal server location. We would have preferred it if the software allowed us to save our favorite server locations.

Clicking the gear icon in the top right-hand corner takes you through to the settings menu. These settings are very basic, with options for automatic startup, as well as an option to turn on Wi-Fi security. We didn’t find any configurable settings, giving the VPN a very out-of-the-box feel, and we would have liked to see more customizable configurations for the software.

Connection and Speed

AVG state that the connection speeds for their VPN have significantly improved as they expand their server network. When connecting to local U.S. servers, we experienced rates between 45 to 50-Mbps, which is more than adequate for streaming and fast download times.

Connecting to the United States servers from the U.K. was a bit slower, but still offered satisfactory speeds of 40-Mbps. The further we get into mainland Europe, the lower the speed tests. Fortunately, connection speeds to Australia were faster than most competitors, with average rates clocking in at 30-Mbps.

We found that uploads were not as consistent as downloads, but that par for the course with most VPN providers. However, slow upload may deter people who are frequent users of P2P services.

While speed was excellent, we found the latency to be unacceptably high. Even when connecting to servers in the same city as our geographic location, we found ping time to measure in at 16-ms, which is a terrible performance.

These latency issues mean that many gamers will have problems playing live, and may want to consider another VPN service. Our research into other VPNs shows average latency times of 2-ms for local connections, making AVG one of the worst providers available.

Security and Encryption

When it comes to rating the security and encryption of AVG Secure VPN, we also found it lacking in some departments. The Wi-Fi protection offers adequate countermeasures to avoid public hacks in open Wi-Fi spots, but users with privacy concerns may want to look into other software if they use open networks frequently.

Both the Windows client and Android app, we tested use OpenVPN protocol, with no option to switch to other protocols in the settings. We found this frustrating, as AVG does not mention this in their sales material, and we needed to use the support chat to discover this fact.

The encryption uses the industry standard 256-bit model, which is a military-grade encryption level offering the highest level of security to users. Our biggest gripe with AVG Secure VPN is that they don’t provide an internet kill switch with the software.

Should your connection fail, then the program will expose your real I.P. address – this is an unacceptable feature to leave out of the package, especially when we consider the subscription price being in the premium segment of the market.

Our DNS leak tests gave us no issues, and we pleased to find that the connection remained stable for most of our session, without any drops.

Netflix Blocked for Most Locations

One of the favorite uses of a VPN is the fact that it can get around geoblocks preventing you from watching certain content online. By routing your connection through a VPN, you can connect to services like the U.S. version of Netflix.

While most VPN providers have dedicated Netflix servers for streaming, it’s clear that AVG does not think this feature is worth adding to its service. When we tried to watch the U.S. version of Netflix, we found that more than half of the server locations we tried did not gain access to the site.

We did eventually establish a connection using the North American services, but their dedicated streaming servers proved to be worthless in our testing.

Limited Torrenting and P2P Locations

Downloading Torrent files is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for using a VPN service. Once again, AVG falls short in this department. We tested Torrenting on their dedicated P2P servers and found results to be less than impressive.

At the moment, AVG allows Torrenting through the following dedicated servers.

London.
Paris.
Prague.
Frankfurt.
Amsterdam.
Brazil.
Seattle.
Miami.
New York.

However, while the Windows client lists Brazil as an active P2P server, we find that it does not show up on the Android app as a valid P2P location.

The limited choice available may turn off those P2P users that rely on faster upload times. Fortunately, AVG does not limit bandwidth to these servers, so you have no limits on file size or restrictions on session bandwidth consumption.

User-Friendly App

We downloaded the Android app for our smartphone to test the mobile functionality of the program. As a note, the app is also available for all iOS devices as well. Similar to the desktop client, the app has a 30-day trial period with the same terms and conditions as the desktop client.

After downloading and installing the app, we opened the interface to find a clean, user-friendly control panel – with hardly any features. Like the desktop client, the mobile app is extremely sparse in terms of features and functionality.

The app automatically chooses the server that’s offering the best speeds, and the optimized server can vary depending on your location. This type of functionality is similar to what we see with other VPN apps, so it’s nothing to get us excited.

By clicking the “change location” button, you gain access to the server list and can make your choice manually. You also have the option to choose dedicated servers in the mobile app. Overall, the app is user-friendly, but we think that’s because it is so featureless that there is nothing to include in the control panel.

Navigating the settings is easy, but once again, there is no option to customize your settings configuration.

AVG Secure VPN Server Locations

AVG may advertise an extensive server network, but when we take a look at what’s on offer, it tells a different story. There are limited server locations, especially outside of the United States, with AVG hosting servers in 29-cities across 21-countries.

Seven of the locations reside in the Us, with servers in New York, Chicago, Miami, Dallas, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle. Montreal and Toronto house the company’s Canadian servers.

Europe has the next most extensive concentration of servers, with locations in London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Helsinki, Paris, Milan, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Russia, Warsaw, and the Czech Republic.

International locations include Johannesburg in South Africa, Australia, Tokyo, and Singapore, along with servers in Turkey. South America has server locations in Mexico City and Sao Paolo, Brazil.

The list is not impressive, and we found that speeds outside of the US, Canada, and Europe, to be relatively weak compared to other VPN providers.

Customer Support

AVG doesn’t give a hoot about customer service from our experience with the company. The website has limited information on their products, and the email support took 48-hours to get back to us with a simple query.

Almost every other VPN provider offers a live chat, and when we have issues, it’s the first place we go to for support. AVG does not provide this service –which is very disappointing.

Other VPN Providers

Some other providers we have covered before on Blockonomi are as follows:

CyberGhost
Avast Secureline
NordVPN
ExpressVPN
Wrapping Up – The Verdict

If you’re looking to buy an over-priced VPN that may or may not track your movements on the internet, then AVG is the ideal product for you. However, if you have serious concerns over your privacy, you’re a gamer, or you enjoy downloading and uploading P2P, then AVG is a poor choice.

Considering the cost of this software, and the functionality – AVG leaves a lot to be desired from its offering. While the basic functionality of the VPN is adequate, the costs are not great, and we feel you would be better off going with another VPN provider, like ExpressVPN or NordVPN.

Taking a brief overlook of the pros and cons of this software, we find;

Pros

Comfortable, clean user interface.
U.S. and U.K. servers offer decent streaming speeds.
30-day trial.
30-day money-back guarantee.

Cons

Deceptive refund terms.
Minimal features and no configurable settings.
Limited server performance and locations.
Shady data and logging policies.
Average customer support levels.
Poor pricing for what’s on offer.

This VPN is probably the bottom of the barrel, The legacy behind AVG had our hopes up for this product. However, after spending a few days using the VPN, we find it to be lacking in several notable features, the performance is nothing worth shouting about and their privacy / no-log policy is very poor.

The bottom line? Look for another product.

Remember that the MT4 platform will send the transaction instructions to the given MT4 server.

ATFX offers a range of order types to choose from. Pending order options include Buy Limit, Buy Stop, Sell Stop, and Sell Limit. A Take Profit or Stop Less closes pending orders. All pending orders connect to company instructions within the server. The pending order is triggered, then transacted and executed in the form of a market order.

ATFX Awards

Over the years, ATFX has earned numerous awards across various markets. It was named the Best NDD Forex Broker 2018 from the Online Personal Wealth AwardsMoneyAM. ATFX was also honored with Best Forex Customer Services 2017 at the Entrepreneur JFEX Awards and 13th Jordan Forex Expo. It was named the Top Forex Broker 2017 by Third Session of Chinese Foreign Exchange Brokers Annual Conference HT Financial. ATFX was also the Best Branded Broker 2017 from Shenzhen Huiyu Financial. It was also the Best Forex Broker 2017 at Tapei International FinanceWord Forum FinanceWord.

How Does ATFX Protect Client Funds?

ATFX has a strong commitment to ensuring that client funds remain safe at all times. The company uses the latest encryption technology currently available to protect data. This is combined with effective protection measures and strict supervision. The result is a trading environment that is safe and reliable.

Additionally, ATFX segregates client funds in trust accounts. Its custodian bank is Barclays Bank PLC. Holding client funds in segregated accounts ensures the funds are always separate from those of ATFX. Furthermore, if something happens to ATFX and it becomes insolvent, your funds are safe. Since they are segregated, they cannot be used to reimburse creditors.

To add to the protections in the unlikely event of insolvency, AT Global Markets (UK) Limited clients have FSCS coverage. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme is available to clients in organizations regulated by the FCA. The scheme comes into play in the rare case that ATFX cannot satisfy its repayment claims. In this situation, the FSCS provides as much as £50,000 in compensation per person for eligible investments.

ATFX also has its own self-developed accounting system which is automatic. It ensures that withdrawals are only possible when the identity of the client matches the information on the account. For further finance transparency, ATFX has partnerships with EY, a professional audit organization.

How Do You Contact ATFX?

For the convenience of clients, ATFX offers multiple methods of contacting the team. There are main phone lines available on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., UK time. There is an 800 number from the UK and a separate number for calls from outside the UK. Or you can send an email to the relevant department. The Contact Us section of the ATFX website lists all. Email addresses are for general information, complaints/disputes, partnerships, support, and sales inquiries. You can also contact support via live chat in the bottom right corner of the page.

ATFX Help Center

One area in which ATFX is lacking is a help center. Most brokers have an obvious help center or section with FAQs. There is no such obvious section of the ATFX website. Instead, there are webinars and there is ready information for contacting customer support. There are some sections with FAQs, such as those related to trading. Overall, however, there is no convenient way to find information on other FAQs. It would be nice to have a dedicated section for information such as this. It would make it easier to open an account, fund the account, and do basic troubleshooting without contacting ATFX.

ATFX Complaints

Since ATFX is a regulated firm, it has a clear complaint-handling procedure. Any complaint is handled thoroughly. This includes a full response as well as an explanation. The staff at ATFX all undergo complaint-handling training. In most cases, ATFX is able to resolve complaints early on.

In the rare case of an unresolved complaint, clients can sometimes refer to the FOS. This independent body has the purpose of investigating complaints made against regulated firms. The FOS will investigate your complaint and deliver a response. For the best results and least hassle, ATFX suggests only contacting the FOS following a final response from ATFX.

ATFX Sponsorships

To be involved in the community, ATFX sponsors some events. This includes The Duke of Edinburgh Cup, the China Event 2018. ATFX chose to sponsor this particular event since it began in the UK and is promoted in regions worldwide. Additionally, the Duke of Edinburgh Cup is a known charity that has Royal Patronage. The charity helps young people around the world. This lines up with the philosophy of ATFX, which further encouraged the broker to sponsor the event. This particular event is long-standing, with 18 years of events. Over 20 countries from five continents have participated and there have been over 134 tournaments.

Conclusion

ATFX is a broker with its headquarters in the United Kingdom, specifically London. This broker offers trading for a range of assets, including forex, CFDs, and commodities. There are several types of accounts available, including for Professional Clients.

ATFX offers competitive spreads and has no commissions.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

Another major plus is the wealth of resources made available on the platform, and the Support Section contains a number of guides, and FAQs that help people get to grips with the most important issues.

Furthermore, the team maintain a blog that details a number of key concepts for newer traders, and also provide further assistance via their Telegram group, YouTube Channel, and other social media channels, and members can gain access to the 3Commas Discord from inside their accounts.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds

How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

Another major plus is the wealth of resources made available on the platform, and the Support Section contains a number of guides, and FAQs that help people get to grips with the most important issues.

Furthermore, the team maintain a blog that details a number of key concepts for newer traders, and also provide further assistance via their Telegram group, YouTube Channel, and other social media channels, and members can gain access to the 3Commas Discord from inside their accounts.

"KuCoin Review: Cryptocurrency Exchange With Margin, Futures & Earning Options","Whether you are looking to buy digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with a debit/credit card or trade crypto-to-crypto pairs…","Whether you are looking to buy digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with a debit/credit card or trade crypto-to-crypto pairs – KuCoin covers both bases.

The global exchange and third-party broker is home to some of the largest trading volumes in the space, alongside a fee-structure that should suit most budgets.

In this guide, we review the ins and outs of KuCoin. This includes an in-depth look at the platform’s supported coins, fiat currency facilities, fees and commissions, safety, customer support, and trading arena.

What is KuCoin?

Contents [Show]

Launched as recently as 2017, KuCoin is a cryptocurrency exchange that also offers third-party brokerage services. Although the platform has just three years of trading history, it is now one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the space.

One of the main reasons for this is that you will find over 200 coins with about 450 cryptocurrency pairs hosted at the exchange. Not only does this include major pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, but heaps of crypto-cross pairs. Best of all, if you have an appetite to trade a less liquid ERC-20 token, chances are you will find it at KuCoin.

Kucoin Homepage

KuCoin was initially a cryptocurrency-only platform, meaning that you could not deposit funds with fiat currency. However, the platform has since formed a partnership with Simplex – a European payment provider that bridges the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday money.

When it comes to cryptocurrency trading fees, KuCoin charges just 0.10%. This puts it on par with the likes of Binance. Similarly, KuCoin is also behind its own digital token – KuCoin Shares (KCS). By owning and storing KCS tokens, you will benefit from discounted trading fees, as well as an entitlement to a share of the trading commissions that KuCoin collects.

In terms of the numbers, KuCoin claims to have facilitated more than 650 million individual trades since its inception in 2017. This translates to more than $71 billion in accumulated trading volumes.

Finally – and as we cover in more detail further down, KuCoin is not regulated by a national licensing body. Although this means that you will be able to trade cryptocurrencies without supplying any ID, this won’t be the case if you wish to buy digital coins with a debit/credit card through Simplex.

What can you Trade at KuCoin?

KuCoin offers a vast range of financial instruments that goes above and beyond just crypto-to-crypto pairs. On the contrary, the platform also offers cryptocurrency indexes, margin trading, and even futures.

Let’s explore each asset class in more detail.

Crypto-to-Crypto Pairs

Each and every trading pair at KuCoin falls within the remit of crypto-to-crypto, not least because it does not offer any fiat-denominated instruments. Instead, you will need to trade your chosen cryptocurrency against the USDT if you want access to the crypto-to-USD space.

If you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency trader then you will know first hand that this is industry standard anyway, so you’ll have no issues with trading volumes or liquidity.

Outside of USDT, you can trade crypto-cross pairs. Examples of this include BTC/ETH, ETH/XRP, and BSC/BTC. Ultimately, listing each and every trading digital currency is beyond the remit of this review, albeit, rest assured that the platform hosts more than 450 pairs.

Some of the Kucoin markets

Crucially, KuCoin is often one of the very first exchanges that newly launched cryptocurrency token projects opt for. As such, support for less liquid digital tokens is something that the team at KuCoin actively look to facilitate.

For a full breakdown of each and every pair that KuCoin hosts, you can find this information here at CoinMarketCap.

KuCoin Indexes

On top of traditional crypto-cross pairs, KuCoin also offers a number of indexes. The concept here is that KuCoin will take the weighted average of a specific cryptocurrency across several leading exchanges.

This is with the view of offering a more accurate price of the coin in question, as it takes into account the variations that you often find between competing platforms.

KuCoin indexes are available across:

Bitcoin
Ethereum
Ripple
Litecoin

The cryptocurrency exchanges that KuCoin derives its pricing activity from are:

Coinbase
Bitstamp
Kraken
Gemini
Bittrex
Liquid

The price of each index is denominated in USD, but settled in the respective cryptocurrency.

KuCoin Futures

Launched in mid-2019, the KuCoin Mercantile Exchange allows you to trade Bitcoin futures. KuCoin itself notes that it is looking to challenge the likes of BitMEX in this particular area of the cryptocurrency derivative space. As a result, you will have access to Bitcoin futures alongside a substantial margin position of up to 100x.

In simple terms, this means that a $100 account balance would permit a maximum trade value of $10,000. When it comes to the underlying spot price, KuCoin once again takes the weighted average from various leading exchanges – such as Kraken, Coinbase Pro, and Bitstamp.

Kucoin Futures

At the time of writing, KuCoin only supports BTC and ETH futures, although it hopes to add further digital currencies in the near future. When it comes to fees, expect to pay 0.060% as a market taker, and 0.020% as a maker. There are also settlement fees of 0.025%.

Trading Fees and Commissions

First and foremost, there are no fees associated with cryptocurrency deposits, and withdrawals are charged at the standard mining rate as per the coin you are looking to cash out.

When it comes to trading fees outside of the futures arena, you will pay 0.1%. This means that a $10,000 trade would cost you $10 in fees. As we briefly mentioned earlier, this sits in-line with fellow exchange counterpart Binance.

KuCoin Shares (KCS)

KuCoin Shares – or simply KCS, is a proprietary cryptocurrency token created by the exchange. By owning and holding KCS tokens you will be accustomed to a number of benefits.

This includes:

Discounted Trading Fees

One of the most notable benefits of holding KuCoin Shares is that you will get discounted trading fees. Crucially, while a standard fee of 0.1% is industry-leading, you stand the potential to reduce this by an additional 20%. What you need to do is to simply turn on the KCS Pay Fee button and enjoy the discount.

Dividends

On top of reducing your trading commissions, holding an allocation of KuCoin Shares affords you the opportunity to earn dividends. In a nutshell, KuCoin as a platform will distribute 50% of the trading commissions that it collects from members each and every day.

This is then distributed proportionately across all holders of KuCoin Shares. For example, let’s suppose that you hold 1% of the entire KCS supply. If the platform pays out $250,000 in commissions, you would receive $2,500. You need to hold at least 6 KCS to benefit from the dividends.

Price History and Buying KuCoin Shares

To say the value of KuCoin Shares has capitulated since its all-time highs of January 2018 would be an understatement. At a peak of over $20 each, you can now obtain the very same tokens for less than $1 in mid-2020.

Nevertheless, if you do want to get your hands on KuCoin Shares you can do this by exchanging them at the platform for an alternative cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Fiat Currency Facilities at KuCoin

As the end of 2018, KuCoin has since formed a partnership with European-based payment provider Simplex. The partnership ensures that users from over 100 countries can now deposit real-world funds with a debit or credit card.

This is ideal if you are looking to trade cryptocurrencies, futures at KuCoin but you do not have any digital currencies available to you. Instead, you can simply enter your debit/credit card details and get cash directly into the platform.

Purchase crypto with credit card

With that being said, it is important to note that the fees associated with this are not cheap. Although the occasional promotion is offered on deposit fees, this will cost you a whopping 2.5 – 3.5% (with a $10 minimum).

This means that a $1000 debit/credit card deposit would cost you $25 in fees. It is noticed that this is slightly cheaper than the likes of Coinbase, which charges 3.99% (with various minimums in place).

Also, KuCoin is developing an OTC Trading Desk, on which all users could buy and sell major coins like BTC, USDT, PAX without any fee. The OTC platform currently supports USD, CAD, CNY, IDR and VND.

Trading Platforms

KuCoin offers a proprietary trading platform that was built from the ground-up. There is no requirement to download or install any software to your desktop device, as the KuCoin trading arena can be accessed through your standard web browser. The platform is potentially suited to both newbie investors and seasoned traders.

The reason we say this is that while the platform is super-clean and easy to navigate through, there are heaps of advanced tools available at your disposal. In fact, you have the ability to fully customize your KuCoin trading screen however you see fit.

Kucoin Trading Screen

When it comes to trading volumes and the availability of liquidity, you should have no concerns at all when trading more popular pairs. You might, however, find that volumes are low on less liquid pairs – especially those involving ERC-20 tokens.

Mobile Trading

If you have a tendency to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies on the move, then you might be interested in the KuCoin mobile trading app.

The application is available to download on iOS and Android devices. You will have access to most account features on the app, such as placing orders, checking the value of your portfolio, and depositing and withdrawing funds.

How Long do Withdrawals Take at KuCoin?

In the vast majority of cases, KuCoin will process your withdrawals within 30 minutes of receiving the request. The platform notes that this is automated, and that manual authorization is only required if the size of your deposit is larger than 100,000 times that of the handling fee (mining fee).

Once the funds leave KuCoin, they will be transferred to the cryptocurrency wallet address of your choosing. Make sure that the address is valid, as there is nothing that KuCoin can do if you make an error!

Kucoin Withdrawals
Earn Interest at KuCoin

An additional feature available at KuCoin is that of its lending program. In its most basic form, you stand the chance of earning interest on your digital currency holdings by loaning it out. The main concept is that the tokens will be used to help fund margin accounts.

For example, let’s suppose that a KuCoin trader decides to apply leverage of 10x on an order. For each day that the position is kept open overnight, the trader would need to pay interest. This is because they are trading with more than they have in their account and thus – this comes at a cost.

Earn interest lending your cryptocurrency

With that said, KuCoin has opened its doors to everyday investors by giving you the opportunity to fund margin positions. This is available on several coins – including USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and many more.

In terms of the specific interest rate, this will vary from coin to coin. As an example, by lending out Bitcoin for 28 days, you could be earning an annualized interest rate of 4.83%.

If this is something that you are interested in exploring, KuCoin offers a profit estimation calculator. You simply need to specify how much you are willing to lend out, on what digital currency, and for what length of time – and the calculator will advise you how much you can earn.

It is important to remember that although the rates of interest on offer are super-competitive, you must consider the risks associated with this. After all, KuCoin is not a regulated cryptocurrency exchange so you must factor this into your risk vs reward model.

Is KuCoin Safe?

As is the case with all cryptocurrency exchanges, it is crucial that you are able to ascertain whether or not KuCoin is safe. Not only does this include the platform’s regulatory standing, but its internal and external security practices, too.

Let’s break these metrics down in more detail.

Regulation

In a nutshell, KuCoin is not regulated by any national licensing bodies. This isn’t a major surprise in the cryptocurrency exchange arena, as lots of platforms choose to operate without a license. Whether or not you feel comfortable trading at an unregulated exchange depends on what side of the fence you sit on.

For example, if you are the type of trader that prefers to buy and sell cryptocurrency pairs in an anonymous nature, then there is every chance that a platform like KuCoin is suitable for your needs. At the other end of the spectrum, if you are the type of trader that demands a regulatory safeguard of some sort, then KuCoin might not suffice.

KYC

As noted above, KuCoin is not required to ask you for any personal information – nor will they demand sensitive identity documents. However, the one exception to this rule is if you plan to deposit funds with a debit or credit card through the Simplex integration.

In fact, in order to remain compliant with all relevant laws surrounding anti-money laundering, you will need to upload a copy of your government-issued ID (passport or driver’s license). This is just the nature of the game when using fiat currency at a crypto-exchange.

KuCoin Security Practices

In terms of internal security practices, KuCoin claims to run institutional-grade systems that ensures it keeps crime away from the platform. This is fully supported by a commitment to cold storage.

Although the exact percentage is not specified by KuCoin, it is claimed that the vast bulk of client funds are held offline. The remainder is kept in hot wallets to ensure the platform is able to meet its offering of near-instant and automated withdrawals.

To date, there have been no publications of KuCoin encountering a major hack of any sort, which is an excellent sign. With that said, you always need to ensure you understand the risks of a potential external hack, as your funds are being stored in wallets that you do not personally control.

Also, it is worth noting that in April 2020, KuCoin completed a strategic cooperation with Onchain Custodian, Singapore’s crypto asset custody platform. Onchain Custodian will offer custody service for the safekeeping of KuCoin crypto assets. The custodial funds will be backed by Lockton, the world’s largest private insurance brokerage company. This is believed to further enhance the exchange’s security level.

2FA

Best of all, KuCoin allows you to install two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account. This means that a unique code will be sent to your mobile device whenever you wish to perform key account functions. This includes logging into your account and making a withdrawal request.

KuCoin Customer Support

When it comes to customer service, the team at KuCoin provides an around the clock support team that operates 24 hours per day – 7 days per week. You can send the team an email, albeit, if you need instant one-on-one support you are best advised to use the live chat facility.

Kucoin Customer Support

Sentiment on this is somewhat mixed in the public domain. With some users reporting connection times in the seconds, others have noted that waiting times are beyond acceptable. With that said, it all depends on how busy the team is at the time of the request. There is no telephone support service offered.

How to get Started at KuCoin

Like the sound of KuCoin and think the platform is suitable for your long-term trading needs? If so, we are now going to show you what you need to do to get started with a trading account today.

Step 1: Open an Account

To get the ball rolling, head over to the KuCoin homepage and click on the ‘Sign Up’ button at the top of the screen. You will then be prompted to enter your email address and to choose a strong password.

You will need to verify your email address before linking up 2FA via your mobile phone. At this stage of the registration process, you will not be asked for any personal information.

Kucoin Signup
Step 2: Deposit Funds

Once you have opened your KuCoin account you will then be promoted to deposit some funds. In this respect, you have two options. If you already possess a digital token, you can deposit this straight into KuCoin.

Simply head over to the deposit page and search for the respective coin. Then, click on the deposit tab to reveal your unique wallet address for that specific cryptocurrency.

Copy the address to your clipboard, head over to your private wallet, specify the number of coins you wish to deposit, and confirm the transaction.

Depending on the cryptocurrency you are depositing, it typically takes around 10-20 minutes for the funds to be credited into your KuCoin account.

Fiat Currency Deposit

If you do not have access to a digital currency, you will need to deposit funds with your debit or credit card. Hover over the ‘Buy Crypto’ button and then click on ‘Buy with Credit Card’.

Follow the step-by-step instructions that are presented to you on screen. Crucially, you will be asked to verify your identity before you are able to use your debit/credit card. The end-to-end process is taken care of by Simplex.

Step 3: Start Trading

As soon as your KuCoin account has been funded, you are ready to start trading. The specific trading arena that you need will depend on the type of financial instrument you are looking to access. This is because KuCoin separates its cryptocurrency exchange and future derivative platforms.

KuCoin Review: The Verdict?

In summary, it is clear to see why KuCoin is now one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the space. Not only does it give you access to over 450 cryptocurrency pairs, but you can also trade crypto-specific indexes and Bitcoin futures.

Moreover, standard trading fees amount to just 0.1%, which you can reduce by an additional 20% by paying fee with KuCoin Shares. We also like the fact that you can now deposit funds with a debit or credit card, albeit, you will need to bypass a KYC process first.

The main gripe that we have with KuCoin is that it is not a regulated entity. While this does mean that you can trade crypto-to-crypto pairs anonymously, your funds are never 100% safe.

On the flip side, reports about a KuCoin hack are yet to surface since its inception in 2017 – which is an excellent sign.

"AVG VPN Review: Not The Best Provider, Slow Speeds & Will Share Your Logs","Our VPN reviews are here to help you make an informed decision before committing to a service provider. We review…","Our VPN reviews are here to help you make an informed decision before committing to a service provider. We review all of the top VPN providers to find out who has the better offering. If you’re in the market for online protection, then we have a comprehensive list of VPN providers. We measure all of our reviews using the key metrics of pricing, performance, security, privacy, support, and features.

In this review, we take a look at AVG Secure VPN. Considering we used AVG free anti-virus in the past with excellent result, we were expecting big things from AVG with the release of this software. Read on to see how AVG measures up to the competition.

AVG VPN

Contents [Show]

Before the rise of Microsoft Security Essentials, AVG anti-virus was the most popular free security software on the internet. Everyone used AVG free in the early days of the internet, and it’s still around today.

With demand for its anti-virus products lagging behind other industry leaders, it appears that the management team at AVG are intent on diversifying their strategy into other related security products.

As a result, we have the launch of AVG VPN, a product designed to protect your online activities.

We have to say that we were excited to give this software a try, but after installing the client and reviewing the features, we were a bit disappointed. After analyzing the performance, things were not looking good for AVG.

Let’s unpack AVG Secure VPN and review it piece by piece.

AVG Secure VPN Pricing

We start with the pricing. While AVG free anti-virus didn’t cost a cent to download, install, and use – AVG Secure VPN it a different animal. The company charge for this product and they are not afraid to drop a hefty price tag on their product. Perhaps the company thought that their reputation in the market allows them to enter at a premium price level.

AVG adopt a different pricing structure to other VPN providers. AVG offers all the features of their VPN to their customers, regardless of the subscription they choose. There is no monthly or quarterly option on the VPN, with only annual plans available. AVG offers you a discount model if you decide to choose a 2-year or 3-year subscription to the service.

Your monthly cost for the software equates to $6.66 a month if you choose the annual plan, and AVG discounts the rate to $6.11 per month on the 3-year plan. We like the fact that they offer the VPN on a free 30-day trial, and your purchase comes backed with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

We also enjoyed that the free trial asked us for no personal information; we click on the download button and execute the file to run the program. After the trial period expires, AVG cancels your service if you don’t take a subscription.

Be careful of your data consumption while using the free version. AVG put a 10GB cap on your downloads for the free trial, and we imagine that many users will burn through this on the first day. If you exceed the limit, then you no longer qualify for the money-back guarantee on your purchase of the software.

AVG also revokes your money-back guarantee if you log onto the internet more than 100-times using the VPN. We found this a sneaky marketing tactic, as most other VPN providers don’t mention these types of restrictions in their “no questions asked” refund policies.

The pricing for AVG Secure VPN is as follows;

3-Years US$6.11 per month.
2-Years US$6.24 per month.
1-year US$6.66 per month.

It’s also important to note that AVG charges for the entire subscription fee upfront. Considering that the pricing is higher than many other premium VPNs, such as Nord VPN or Private Internet Access, this puts AVG on the back foot from the get-go. We hope that the performance of this product justifies the price tag.

Payment Options

It seems that from the moment you commit to purchase AVG Secure VPN, that where everything starts to go wrong. After pulling us through to the payment page, we find that AVG only offers payment for their software with a credit card or PayPal. Now while that suits us fine, we imagine that international customers would like to see alternative payment options like WorldPay, AliPay or Cryptocurrency.

Also, when we contacted one of our friends in Africa, they said that they only had the option to pay with a credit card, and PayPal was not available.

We would like to see the inclusion of more payment systems, as it gives us confidence in the fact that there is demand for the product in emerging markets, meaning that their servers must have a global footprint, and the service works well all over the globe.

Cryptocurrency payments are not available through AVG, which is a pity – especially since we think this payment method is a favorite among people who take online security seriously.

AVG Secure VPN Refund Policy

Most VPN providers offer a free trial of their software, or they issue you with a money-back guarantee with your purchase. AVG decided to do both.

Provided you comply with the rules of the refund, (less than 10GB or downloads, and fewer than 100-session logins,) then you qualify for a refund at any stage of the 30-day guarantee period.

We found the refund process to be painless, and all we needed to do was email the support desk with our refund request.

The company did not send us through customer retention, and they issued the refund the same day. The money returned to our credit card account in 8-business days after receiving the refund receipt.

Headquartered in the Czech Republic – A Data Safe Haven

The “14-Eyes,” is a collaborative effort between the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., and mainland Europe. The project has the goal of surveilling all internet data. If you select a VPN provider within the jurisdiction of the 14-Eyes, then you run the risk of the government picking up on your data usage and browsing history.

In this case, using a VPN residing within the 14-Eyes jurisdiction is a waste of time – it goes against what you are using a VPN for in the first place. Therefore, if you want to remain secure and anonymous in your online activities, you need to choose a VPN provider that resides out of the watchful stare of the 14-Eyes.

Fortunately, AVG Secure VPN has its headquarters in the Czech Republic, away from the 14-eyes jurisdiction. This location gives AVG management the right to refuse to co-operate with any government subpoena for data logs on the company’s users.

Privacy Policy and Data Collection

AVG Secure VPN claim that they have a “no-logs” policy. This statement means that they do not record what you do online with their VPN product. This policy is a key criterion for a VPN, and many users trust their service provider to keep their activities private and secure.

However, AVG does mention that if they receive reports of abuse, they will investigate the claim. The company also claims that they do not allow their customers to use the VPN service to share or distribute pirated content. This clause is pretty standard for the course, but we don’t see this type of language in the terms and conditions of many other VPN providers.

What caught our attention was when we read through the privacy policy for all AVG products, including the VPN service.

It turns out that AVG is collecting a substantial amount of data on its users, and storing them in their servers. Email addresses, phone numbers, SIM card numbers, location data, and your I.P. address are a few examples of the account data accessed by AVG, which can identify you online.

AVG state that they also have the right to share your data with interested third parties, and this includes handing over your session logs to law enforcement if they subpoena the company.

We can’t accept these terms of service, and we find it appalling that AVG would promote their product without clearly informing their customers of these terms. Essentially, there is very little protection on offer from the company, and they will hang you out to dry if the 14-Eyes demand it to be so.

AVG is part of the Avast Group, with headquarters in Amsterdam. Their senior management comprises of U.S. citizens, and we don’t see any reason for them to avoid requests from the 14-Eyes.

User-Interface

We enjoy using apps with clean interfaces – there’s nothing worse than opening an app to a cluttered dashboard; that’s why we appreciate apps with clean interfaces. However, saying that AVG Secure VPN has a clean c-panel would be an understatement.

The AVG Secure VPN dash has very few features. The only data available on the main screen is your server location and connection status. Call us picky – but we would like to see other features like our current I.P. address and connection speed.

Considering the bare-bones nature of the main screen, we are surprised to see that it takes up so much space when we open the desktop client. The main screen gives you access to the list of server locations by clicking the “change location” button, which opens the server list in a separate window.

We enjoyed the look and feel of the server lists, as AVG have all of their locations listed by continent, making it easy to select your ideal server location. We would have preferred it if the software allowed us to save our favorite server locations.

Clicking the gear icon in the top right-hand corner takes you through to the settings menu. These settings are very basic, with options for automatic startup, as well as an option to turn on Wi-Fi security. We didn’t find any configurable settings, giving the VPN a very out-of-the-box feel, and we would have liked to see more customizable configurations for the software.

Connection and Speed

AVG state that the connection speeds for their VPN have significantly improved as they expand their server network. When connecting to local U.S. servers, we experienced rates between 45 to 50-Mbps, which is more than adequate for streaming and fast download times.

Connecting to the United States servers from the U.K. was a bit slower, but still offered satisfactory speeds of 40-Mbps. The further we get into mainland Europe, the lower the speed tests. Fortunately, connection speeds to Australia were faster than most competitors, with average rates clocking in at 30-Mbps.

We found that uploads were not as consistent as downloads, but that par for the course with most VPN providers. However, slow upload may deter people who are frequent users of P2P services.

While speed was excellent, we found the latency to be unacceptably high. Even when connecting to servers in the same city as our geographic location, we found ping time to measure in at 16-ms, which is a terrible performance.

These latency issues mean that many gamers will have problems playing live, and may want to consider another VPN service. Our research into other VPNs shows average latency times of 2-ms for local connections, making AVG one of the worst providers available.

Security and Encryption

When it comes to rating the security and encryption of AVG Secure VPN, we also found it lacking in some departments. The Wi-Fi protection offers adequate countermeasures to avoid public hacks in open Wi-Fi spots, but users with privacy concerns may want to look into other software if they use open networks frequently.

Both the Windows client and Android app, we tested use OpenVPN protocol, with no option to switch to other protocols in the settings. We found this frustrating, as AVG does not mention this in their sales material, and we needed to use the support chat to discover this fact.

The encryption uses the industry standard 256-bit model, which is a military-grade encryption level offering the highest level of security to users. Our biggest gripe with AVG Secure VPN is that they don’t provide an internet kill switch with the software.

Should your connection fail, then the program will expose your real I.P. address – this is an unacceptable feature to leave out of the package, especially when we consider the subscription price being in the premium segment of the market.

Our DNS leak tests gave us no issues, and we pleased to find that the connection remained stable for most of our session, without any drops.

Netflix Blocked for Most Locations

One of the favorite uses of a VPN is the fact that it can get around geoblocks preventing you from watching certain content online. By routing your connection through a VPN, you can connect to services like the U.S. version of Netflix.

While most VPN providers have dedicated Netflix servers for streaming, it’s clear that AVG does not think this feature is worth adding to its service. When we tried to watch the U.S. version of Netflix, we found that more than half of the server locations we tried did not gain access to the site.

We did eventually establish a connection using the North American services, but their dedicated streaming servers proved to be worthless in our testing.

Limited Torrenting and P2P Locations

Downloading Torrent files is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for using a VPN service. Once again, AVG falls short in this department. We tested Torrenting on their dedicated P2P servers and found results to be less than impressive.

At the moment, AVG allows Torrenting through the following dedicated servers.

London.
Paris.
Prague.
Frankfurt.
Amsterdam.
Brazil.
Seattle.
Miami.
New York.

However, while the Windows client lists Brazil as an active P2P server, we find that it does not show up on the Android app as a valid P2P location.

The limited choice available may turn off those P2P users that rely on faster upload times. Fortunately, AVG does not limit bandwidth to these servers, so you have no limits on file size or restrictions on session bandwidth consumption.

User-Friendly App

We downloaded the Android app for our smartphone to test the mobile functionality of the program. As a note, the app is also available for all iOS devices as well. Similar to the desktop client, the app has a 30-day trial period with the same terms and conditions as the desktop client.

After downloading and installing the app, we opened the interface to find a clean, user-friendly control panel – with hardly any features. Like the desktop client, the mobile app is extremely sparse in terms of features and functionality.

The app automatically chooses the server that’s offering the best speeds, and the optimized server can vary depending on your location. This type of functionality is similar to what we see with other VPN apps, so it’s nothing to get us excited.

By clicking the “change location” button, you gain access to the server list and can make your choice manually. You also have the option to choose dedicated servers in the mobile app. Overall, the app is user-friendly, but we think that’s because it is so featureless that there is nothing to include in the control panel.

Navigating the settings is easy, but once again, there is no option to customize your settings configuration.

AVG Secure VPN Server Locations

AVG may advertise an extensive server network, but when we take a look at what’s on offer, it tells a different story. There are limited server locations, especially outside of the United States, with AVG hosting servers in 29-cities across 21-countries.

Seven of the locations reside in the Us, with servers in New York, Chicago, Miami, Dallas, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle. Montreal and Toronto house the company’s Canadian servers.

Europe has the next most extensive concentration of servers, with locations in London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Helsinki, Paris, Milan, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Russia, Warsaw, and the Czech Republic.

International locations include Johannesburg in South Africa, Australia, Tokyo, and Singapore, along with servers in Turkey. South America has server locations in Mexico City and Sao Paolo, Brazil.

The list is not impressive, and we found that speeds outside of the US, Canada, and Europe, to be relatively weak compared to other VPN providers.

Customer Support

AVG doesn’t give a hoot about customer service from our experience with the company. The website has limited information on their products, and the email support took 48-hours to get back to us with a simple query.

Almost every other VPN provider offers a live chat, and when we have issues, it’s the first place we go to for support. AVG does not provide this service –which is very disappointing.

Other VPN Providers

Some other providers we have covered before on Blockonomi are as follows:

CyberGhost
Avast Secureline
NordVPN
ExpressVPN
Wrapping Up – The Verdict

If you’re looking to buy an over-priced VPN that may or may not track your movements on the internet, then AVG is the ideal product for you. However, if you have serious concerns over your privacy, you’re a gamer, or you enjoy downloading and uploading P2P, then AVG is a poor choice.

Considering the cost of this software, and the functionality – AVG leaves a lot to be desired from its offering. While the basic functionality of the VPN is adequate, the costs are not great, and we feel you would be better off going with another VPN provider, like ExpressVPN or NordVPN.

Taking a brief overlook of the pros and cons of this software, we find;

Pros

Comfortable, clean user interface.
U.S. and U.K. servers offer decent streaming speeds.
30-day trial.
30-day money-back guarantee.

Cons

Deceptive refund terms.
Minimal features and no configurable settings.
Limited server performance and locations.
Shady data and logging policies.
Average customer support levels.
Poor pricing for what’s on offer.

This VPN is probably the bottom of the barrel, The legacy behind AVG had our hopes up for this product. However, after spending a few days using the VPN, we find it to be lacking in several notable features, the performance is nothing worth shouting about and their privacy / no-log policy is very poor.

The bottom line? Look for another product.

Demo Account

ATFX does have a demo account. This is a great way to get a feel for the offerings of the broker. It can also be a useful tool for beginner traders who need to hone their skills. Or advanced traders can use the demo account to test new strategies.

ATFX Deposits

There are three main deposit methods available on ATFX: credit or debit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets. E-wallets include Safecharge, Neteller, and Skrill. All three methods support deposits in EUR, USD, or GBP. There are no fees for any deposits charged by ATFX. In the case of debit or credit cards from outside the UK, your provider may charge a small processing fee. ATFX will reimburse you for this fee if you provide a receipt to prove the charges. Deposits made with credit cards, debit cards, or e-wallets typically appear within 30 minutes. Bank transfers will appear in your trading account within a working day after ATFX receives the funds.

ATFX Withdrawals

ATFX offers the same withdrawal methods as deposit methods: credit or debit card, e-wallet, or bank transfer. As with deposits, there are no fees charged by ATFX and you can withdraw in EUR, USD, or GBP. Most withdrawals are processed within a working day, but ATFX is not liable for delays. Most withdrawals requests that ATFX receives before 2 p.m. (in the UK) get processed that day.

Following processing, funds will usually clear between 1 and 3 working days. International bank wires typically require 3 to 5 more working days to appear in your account, depending on the bank. Withdrawals via e-wallets will typically arrive within 2 days. Refunds to debit and credit cards typically finish processing in 2 to 5 days.

Remember that for compliance reasons, withdrawals must be returned to your original payment source. In the case of profits on trades from deposits made with a card, the extra funds will go to a bank account. You must also fully verify your ATFX account before you can withdraw funds.

How Do You Deposit and Withdraw Funds With Your ATFX Account?

To deposit funds into your ATFX account, just log into your account. Visit the Client Portal and select Deposit. Remember that ATFX will not accept third-party payments. This means that your deposits must come from your own accounts.

To withdraw funds, visit the Client Portal again. Instead of choosing Deposit, select Withdrawal. Keep in mind that you can only request one withdrawal each day. This improves efficiency for ATFX.

ATFX Promotions

Depending on the country that you sign up for ATFX in, you may have access to a bonus. There is a $100 USD welcome credit promotion. This only requires opening up a Live Account and then depositing $200. Once you trade six lots, the credit becomes withdrawable.

Keep in mind that this bonus is not available to all clients. European guidelines make it very challenging to offer bonuses. These are banned outright in the EU.

ATFX Trading Instruments

One of the focuses of ATFX is offering forex trading. The broker offers 43 different forex trading pairs. Additionally, it constantly reviews its product range. ATFX strives to always offer the broadest possible range of FX pairs. Those pairs include majors, minors, and exotics. The forex market is available 24/5 on ATFX.

ATFX also offers access to trading precious metals. Specifically, you can trade London Gold or London Silver, either of which is on a spot contract.

How Does ATFX Protect Client Funds?

ATFX has a strong commitment to ensuring that client funds remain safe at all times. The company uses the latest encryption technology currently available to protect data. This is combined with effective protection measures and strict supervision. The result is a trading environment that is safe and reliable.

Additionally, ATFX segregates client funds in trust accounts. Its custodian bank is Barclays Bank PLC. Holding client funds in segregated accounts ensures the funds are always separate from those of ATFX. Furthermore, if something happens to ATFX and it becomes insolvent, your funds are safe. Since they are segregated, they cannot be used to reimburse creditors.

To add to the protections in the unlikely event of insolvency, AT Global Markets (UK) Limited clients have FSCS coverage. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme is available to clients in organizations regulated by the FCA. The scheme comes into play in the rare case that ATFX cannot satisfy its repayment claims. In this situation, the FSCS provides as much as £50,000 in compensation per person for eligible investments.

ATFX also has its own self-developed accounting system which is automatic. It ensures that withdrawals are only possible when the identity of the client matches the information on the account. For further finance transparency, ATFX has partnerships with EY, a professional audit organization.

How Do You Contact ATFX?

For the convenience of clients, ATFX offers multiple methods of contacting the team. There are main phone lines available on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., UK time. There is an 800 number from the UK and a separate number for calls from outside the UK. Or you can send an email to the relevant department. The Contact Us section of the ATFX website lists all. Email addresses are for general information, complaints/disputes, partnerships, support, and sales inquiries. You can also contact support via live chat in the bottom right corner of the page.

ATFX Help Center

One area in which ATFX is lacking is a help center. Most brokers have an obvious help center or section with FAQs. There is no such obvious section of the ATFX website. Instead, there are webinars and there is ready information for contacting customer support. There are some sections with FAQs, such as those related to trading. Overall, however, there is no convenient way to find information on other FAQs. It would be nice to have a dedicated section for information such as this. It would make it easier to open an account, fund the account, and do basic troubleshooting without contacting ATFX.

ATFX Complaints

Since ATFX is a regulated firm, it has a clear complaint-handling procedure. Any complaint is handled thoroughly. This includes a full response as well as an explanation. The staff at ATFX all undergo complaint-handling training. In most cases, ATFX is able to resolve complaints early on.

In the rare case of an unresolved complaint, clients can sometimes refer to the FOS. This independent body has the purpose of investigating complaints made against regulated firms. The FOS will investigate your complaint and deliver a response. For the best results and least hassle, ATFX suggests only contacting the FOS following a final response from ATFX.

ATFX Sponsorships

To be involved in the community, ATFX sponsors some events. This includes The Duke of Edinburgh Cup, the China Event 2018. ATFX chose to sponsor this particular event since it began in the UK and is promoted in regions worldwide. Additionally, the Duke of Edinburgh Cup is a known charity that has Royal Patronage. The charity helps young people around the world. This lines up with the philosophy of ATFX, which further encouraged the broker to sponsor the event. This particular event is long-standing, with 18 years of events. Over 20 countries from five continents have participated and there have been over 134 tournaments.

Conclusion

ATFX is a broker with its headquarters in the United Kingdom, specifically London. This broker offers trading for a range of assets, including forex, CFDs, and commodities. There are several types of accounts available, including for Professional Clients.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

"Free Cryptocurrency: Complete Guide to Earning Free Crypto","The last couple of years have marked an increase in the overall public awareness of cryptocurrencies worldwide. In return, a…","The last couple of years have marked an increase in the overall public awareness of cryptocurrencies worldwide. In return, a larger number of people have expressed their interest in purchasing or earning digital currencies.

While buying your favorite coin via an exchange is likely the easiest way to enter the cryptocurrency market, this industry is full of surprises – therefore a noticeable amount of coin can be earned for free.

As such, this article will cover the main methods that can be leveraged in order to obtain free crypto. Do keep in mind that most of these methods require a bit of effort, since nothing is ever truly free. However, these methods do not entail having to work a fulltime job, nor do they imply any monetary investment from your part.

Free Crypto from Coinbase Earn

Contents [Show]

Coinbase is largely seen as one of the most popular digital currency exchanges, especially in the United States.

While the platform facilitates the purchase and sale of crypto, it also offers its users the opportunity to earn several coins, including but not limited to Orchid, Tezos, Dai, EOS, Stellar, Zcash, Basic Attention Token and Ox.

Free crypto at Coinbase Earn.

For example, at the moment you can earn the following cryptos for free:

Orchid: users can earn up to $52 OXT by completing a free course meant to teach you the basics of this privacy-focused coin;
Tezos: completing a course on Tezos and learning about its openness, safety or upgradability will earn you $6 XTZ;
Dai: a similar course-based offer is available for Dai as well, thus granting course participants $20 DAI;
EOS: you can earn up to $50 EOS by completing a course on this coin, and learning more about its goal of facilitating the development of blockchain-based apps;
Stellar Lumens: the completion of a quick course on how Stellar connects payment systems, banks and individuals will earn you $50 XLM;
Zcash: this coin is known for its privacy-focused philosophy – course completion will grant you an undisclosed amount of ZEC tokens;
Basic Attention Token: $8-worth of BAT can be earned by reading on BAT’s vision of fixing the web;
0x: last but not least, educating yourself on OX’s token-based idea of the future web will award you several ZRX tokens.

Do keep in mind that there is a catch to these courses. You must be the holder of a Coinbase exchange account, where all tokens will be credited.

Earning Free Crypto via Airdrops

Airdrops are one of the simplest and most effective methods of earning extra cryptocurrency, especially in the form of newly-announced tokens. The idea behind airdrops is quite simple – innovative and newly-launched projects choose to hold airdrops as an effective marketing strategy, meant to pique the interest of the cryptocurrency community.

Participating in an airdrop is bound to be quite simple. It entails owning an active Ethereum wallet that is ERC-20 compatible, an email address, Telegram account, and in some cases, a Twitter account.

Once these criteria are met, you will have to look for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Security Token Offerings (STOs), and token-based start-ups that have announced an upcoming airdrop.

Most of these platforms will require you to sign-up, by entering your ERC-20 address and email. For marketing purposes, some airdrops may require you to follow them on Twitter, or join the Telegram chat group. This ensures that you’re kept in the loop and quickly become aware of news concerning the token.

Recently, KYC&AML regulations have made it mandatory for numerous airdrops to request identifying details. This is due to the money laundering potential associated with these events. Therefore, if you’re keen on protecting your online privacy, airdrops might not be the best choice for you.

Recently, numerous wallet providers such as Blockchain.com have started sponsoring airdrops.

Signup for free crypto Airdrops

In other words, you are announced whenever a partner start-up is holding an airdrop of their new tokens, and can earn the tokens directly in your wallet. Similarly, there are numerous websites which scour the web looking for new airdrop events. Following will help ensure that you will be one of the first people to know about upcoming airdrops.

Leveraging Bounties for Free Coin

Bounties are quite similar to airdrops, in the sense that they represent free coins given away by crypto project developers. There’s one key difference, however – bounties generally imply that you do some type of work in exchange for the coin.

With this in mind, here are the main types of bounties, alongside a quick description for each:

Bug bounties

Bug bounty campaigns are generally well-paid, yet they are only relevant to people who hold development skills. Programmers throughout the world actively attempt to crack the code of online platforms, while also testing for potential bugs.

As such, crypto and blockchain-based companies may hold bounty campaigns, where developers analyse platform functionality and report any bugs.

Over the last couple of years, there have been numerous instances in which white-hat hackers discovered vulnerabilities or significant bugs in web platforms. In return for this service, and based on the severity of the vulnerability discovered, companies can offer tens of thousands of dollars as compensation.

Signature campaigns

This marketing strategy is often implemented on forums such as Bitcointalk. In exchange for a monthly bounty, forum users add a specific signature, thus indirectly promoting the products and services of a crypto company.

Most businesses holding signature campaigns require forum users to have a higher membership level, which can be obtained through frequent high-quality posts. In return for buying the signature space, companies offer a monthly bounty in tokens.

Numerous bounty programs at Bitcointalk
Translations

Crypto start-ups are always interested in having their content translated into multiple languages. Since many start-ups run on a limited budget, a good method to go about this is to launch a translation bounty. Here, native users translate specific portions of text, in exchange for a number of tokens.

Social media, images, blog posts and video bounties

Last but not least, we also have other promotional bounties. Some companies may ask you to write and post a positive article on their services, whereas others may require you to edit videos, share posts on social media, or create promotional images.

Based on these aspects, bounties do, in fact, represent a method of earning free tokens, yet they imply actual work. Luckily, the work is generally quite easy (apart from bug bounties), and can be completed rather quickly.

Affiliate Marketing and Referrals

At this point in time, most experts define affiliate marketing as the process associated with promoting products and services of various companies, in exchange for a commission on each sale.

A recent research study concluded that US-based affiliate spending may reach $6.8 billion by the end of 2020.

As such, affiliate marketing represents a significant revenue stream for numerous companies, especially those which operate in the online ecosystem.

Therefore, it only makes sense that numerous crypto and blockchain-related businesses have launched their very own affiliate marketing campaigns. Getting involved is bound to be simple – in most instances, you need an account, and a personalized link, which can be shared across the web.

Any service or product that is purchased using your affiliate link or referral code will be credited with a percentage of the sale.

Affiliate marketing can earn you free cryptocurrency as long as you are active online. This implies sharing the link as part of valuable content on a variety of platforms, such as crypto discussion forums, Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or your personal blog.

The possibilities are endless. Your success depends directly on the size of your audience and your overall online reach. However, this means that actual work needs to be carried out in order to get this free crypto. On the other hand, once your links are live, affiliate marketing becomes a lucrative source of passive income, which can be leveraged for a prolonged period of time.

To put things into perspective, here are several crypto-related affiliate campaigns:

Coinbase: if new users sign up using your personalized affiliate link, you are eligible to obtain 50% of the fees charged by the exchange platform for all transactions;
TREZOR: this platform offers 10% of net sales carried out by users who have signed up using your referral;
Ledger: this affiliate program promises to credit 12% – 15% of all sales;
LocalBitcoins: you can expect to earn 20% of the trading fee associated with each transaction that is carried out by referred users;
Binance: this exchange platform offers 20%-40% commissions on transaction fees.

Do keep in mind the fact that these conditions may be modified unilaterally by the website. Therefore, it is always recommended that you carry out your due diligence, and carefully research the affiliate marketing conditions associated with each of the examples given above.

Additionally, note that this list isn’t exhaustive – in fact, there are hundreds of crypto-related affiliate opportunities on the market at this moment.

It certainly isn’t unusual for affiliate marketing to become a main income stream, especially if done right. People have reported earning hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly using affiliate marketing strategies.

Given the fact that we are referring to the digital currency market, your income potential is further increased by crypto price volatility.

However, this entails that you treat it as a fulltime job until enough of your links are published on the web.

Other Free Crypto Offers

A quick search will likely unveil numerous other free cryptocurrency sources. Here are a few examples that we consider relevant:

Wirex

Yet another digital currency card company, Wirex advertises a 0.5% bitcoin-based cashback scheme on all purchases made via the card.

Cryptocurrency gambling

Cryptocurrency gambling can also act as a method for earning free coins, yet extra care should be practiced if you decide to wager your coins. Do keep in mind that most casinos offer crypto faucets, which give out an amount of free coin every time they are clicked on (they are programmed against abuse, however, and serve as a method of encouraging users to keep on playing).

If you do decide to try your luck at a casino, make sure that you choose a platform that relies on a provably-fair protocol. Otherwise, you may expose yourself to rigged games that are bound to steal your hard-earned crypto.

Keep an Eye Out for Scams

Over the last couple of years, the popularity of the cryptocurrency market has increased exponentially. The rise in public awareness was mostly fuelled by intense volatility, and record-breaking prices.

With this in mind, the market is still seen as a way to get rich quickly. While there is significant money-making potential in crypto, this perception has led to the appearance of numerous scams, meant to fraud people out of their money.

Whenever dealing in crypto, there are two aspects worth keeping in mind: if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Also, you should never risk more than you can afford to lose.

Cybersecurity practices dictate that it’s best to always carry out in-depth research on any platform or service that you decide to use. Similarly, you should never give out your personal details or private keys to third parties.

Protection against scams and other forms of fraudulent activity is basically non-existent, whereas transactions are irreversible, therefore due diligence is essential.

 

The Bottom Line

Based on everything that has been highlighted in this guide, most people are only a few clicks away from earning free cryptocurrency.

There are hundreds, if not thousands of offers that you can take advantage of, while most imply an insignificant amount of work. O

n the other hand, those who are serious about creating a crypto-based income stream will be happy to know that affiliate marketing and bug bounty hunting are highly-lucrative passive income streams.","https://blockonomi.com/free-cryptocurrency/"

Pepperstone Spreads & Fees


You can view the current spreads at any time via the Pepperstone website on the Spreads page within the section for “Forex Trading.” This is also where you will find more detailed information about commissions, when applicable. To view the swap rates, right-click on “Market Watch” from the MT4 trading platform and choose “symbols.” Select your currency pair and then “Properties.”

Funding Your Account


You can choose among various base currencies. The base currency is the currency of your account as well as the one you use for deposits. Options include the Australian dollar (AUD), British pound sterling (GBP), United States dollar (USD), euro (EUR), Japanese yen (JPY), Canadian dollar (CAD), New Zealand dollar (NZD), Singapore dollar (SGD), Hong Kong dollar (HKD), and Swiss franc (CHF).

There is an extensive list of funding methods for Pepperstone accounts, including e-wallets and credit and debit cards. You can use Verified by Visa, MasterCard Secure Code, Visa or Mastercard, traditional domestic or international bank transfers, PayPal, POLi for an instant bank transfer, China Union Pay, BPay for transfers from Australian banks, Skrill (Moneybookers), Neteller, Qiwi, Fasapay, other local funding methods, and broker-to-broker transfers.

Many of these methods allow for instant funding 24/7, but you should check the specific timeframe for your chosen funding method. Broker-to-broker transfers typically take two to three days.

Pepperstone will not charge you any fees for a deposit or withdrawal. However, your payment provider might charge you a transfer fee or a conversion fee. It is also noteworthy that Pepperstone does not accept third-party payments, meaning that the name on the Pepperstone account must match the name on the account you use to fund. For joint bank accounts, your name must be one of the parties on the account.

Pepperstone Withdrawals


You can only return funds to a bank account that bears the same name as your Pepperstone account, as with deposits, due to the third-party transaction regulations. Know that if you make a credit card withdrawal, you can only use it for the amount you deposited with the credit card; after that, you must choose another method.

If you fund your account with a credit card and then withdraw within 60 days, the withdrawal will have to go back to your same credit card. Withdrawals are processed the same day if Pepperstone receives them before 21:00 GMT (which is 07:00 AEST). Otherwise, you may need to wait until the following day for processing. Bank Wire Transfer withdrawals typically take three to five business days to arrive in your account.

Pepperstone does not charge fees with withdrawals, but your financial institution could. If this happens, Pepperstone will pass the fee onto you in most cases, including in the case of an international telegraphic transfer fee that Pepperstone’s banking institution charges, which is usually about AUD 20. Any suggested time frames for withdrawals from Pepperstone may be lengthened by unforeseen circumstances.

EDGE Technology

You will notice that all the Pepperstone accounts have “Edge” in their name. This is because the broker uses the EDGE Environment, which is considered the highest-performing portfolio for forex trading technology enterprise clients who want to reduce speeds and enjoy execution acceleration.

EDGE makes it possible to trade via MetaTrader 4 with an improvement of up to 12 times in execution speed and up to 10 times in latency reduction. There are also extra optical fiber connections with Interbank Servers within New York, allowing for one-click MT4 ordering for an ultra-fast trade placement.

There is also Pepperstone Price Improvement (PPI) Technology that routes FX orders intelligently, so it can deliver the optimal price and detect the market hotspots. The EDGE spreads are tight thanks to the new Dark Pool Liquidity. Overall, the EDGE technology allows for one-click trading, a secure client area, ultra-low spreads, dark pool liquidity, price improvement technology, and more than 70 tradable instruments.

You can also view the Interbank Market Depth to help inform your trading decisions.

Pepperstone’s Trading Servers


Pepperstone uses Equinix trading servers to deliver fast trading. This is the broker’s method of staying competitive in the competitive industry of the global electronic financial markets since the electronic trading systems it offers can only work well if the infrastructure is effective.

Because of the need for speed and reliability, Pepperstone chose to partner with Equinix to make a state-of-the-art infrastructure for trading forex just a few miles from New York’s Wall Street. Pepperstone is part of the Equinix Financial eXchange, which is a state-of-the-art network with execution venues, bank trading servers, and sell and buy side firms at the Equinix high-performance data centers.

It is access to this Equinix Financial eXchange that lets Pepperstone deliver low-latency as well as allowing the broker to exchange data directly with customers and strategic partners nearby.

Additionally, Pepperstone has a direct interlink to the multiple providers in Equinix NY4 via Optical Fiber. These direct connections allow for ordered transmissions at higher speeds than conventional internet connections, which leads to reduced latency. Pepperstone also directly connects to the backbone of the global internet.

Pepperstone’s VPS Hosting Options

With access to Virtual Private Servers (VPS), forex traders can run their chosen expert advisors or automated algorithmic strategies 24/7 via a Virtual Machine. This reduces downtime from connectivity and technology failures and Pepperstone has two partnerships that give customers access to VPS hosting.

You can get 20 percent off Pepperstone FXVM VPS, which has ultra-low latency times of just one millisecond. FXVM also has multilingual staff available 24/7 and can help with troubleshooting and installing expert advisors.

Or you can get 20 percent off on a customized Pepperstone VPS plan from New York City Servers for low latency. These high-powered servers run 24/7/365, have a low latency stable connection, and feature fast executions with 24/7 customer support.

In the UK, this is with Barclays. Pepperstone also has additional professional indemnity insurance with Lloyds of London and maintains independent auditing to provide peace of mind.

Pepperstone Pros

One of these qualities is the understanding of what traders want. Pepperstone understands that traders want convenient, fast, and low-cost online forex trading.

Binance is a popular cryptocurrency exchange which was started in China but then moved their headquarters to the crypto-friendly Island of Malta in the EU. Binance is popular for its crypto to crypto exchange services.

Binance exploded onto the scene in the mania of 2017 and has since gone on to become the top crypto exchange in the world.

Binance: The World’s Leading
Cryptocurrency Exchange?

In our review, we will attempt to outline everything that you need know about Binance, including how it works, the crypto pairs that you can exchange, trading fees/limits, security aspects, and customer support.

Visit Binance

How the Exchange Works

Contents [Show]

Those who visit Binance for the first time will quickly notice that the platform offers two options for digital currency trading- basic and advanced.

Neither the basic, nor the advanced versions are bound to be easy to use for complete beginners. However, anyone with a background in digital currencies and with a bit of knowledge into how exchanges work should be able to use the platform and its different services.

The main difference between the basic and the advanced version is that the advanced one offers more-in-depth technical analysis of digital currency value over time.

At this time, the dashboard for the basic version offers several graphs and charts for the pairs that you’re trading, order books, and trade history.

This is what the basic view looks like :

The Basic view is nicely designed and well laid out, all the information you need is clearly presented with prices on the left, graphs in the center along with the buy and sell boxes and the trade history is presented on the right so you can quickly see what the latest trade prices were.

And this is what the advanced view looks like:

The advanced view uses a dark theme and makes the trading charts larger and the latest trade prices are displayed on the right with the buy sell boxes underneath.

Which you choose is a matter of preference really, I like the lighter colored basic view and find the layout a little easier to use.

Binance Signup & Login

To use the exchange, users will first have to create an account. The process behind this is fairly simple and straight-forward and you don’t have to verify your account for level 1 which is a 2BTC daily withdrawal limit.

For level 2 which allows up to 100BTC per day, you need to upload a photo ID and wait till you are approved. There are higher limits still, but you will need to contact them directly to arrange that.

Time for verification can vary depending on how busy the site support staff are, so make sure to plan ahead if you wish to withdraw larger amounts and make sure this step is complete before depositing and trading large sums on the exchange.

Now, that this is out of the way, users can go ahead and fund their Binance account. While you can choose from a multitude of digital currencies, it is recommended that you stick with either BTC or ETH.

To fund your account visit the “Funds” > “Deposits / Withdrawals” link at the top of the site and find the currency you wish to send, then click the “Deposit” button next to it which will then you give you the wallet address.

You can then send your funds to this address to begin trading on the platform, depending on which currency you deposit it will take different times to show up as this is reliant on that currencies blockchain.

Some currencies like Ethereum are faster than Bitcoin which can take a while.

Now that your account is funded, you can simply start trading, exchanging and investing in various digital currency pairs. Binance offers plenty of choices, as they support all major digital currencies, but also numerous ICO listings and their respective tokens.

At this time, the platform can only be used to generate limit and market orders. This has been considered a disadvantage by some, as many expected trading options that would be more advanced.

Following the placement of your order, simply wait for it to be fulfilled according to the terms that have been set.

How to Trade on Binance

Trading on Binance is fairly straight-forward if you have used any other cryptocurrency exchange before.

To get started, make sure you have deposited some funds – there are options for trading pairs in BTC, ETH, BNB and USDT.

Once you have your funds, at the top right menu, select “Exchange” > “Basic” or “Advanced” to load the trading screen. We will be using the Basic view.

On the right hand side, of the screen select a tab from BTC, ETH, BNB or USDT this is what you will be trading in. Then choose your desired currency from the list. You can also search here and you can create a favorites list by clicking the star next to any currencies.

Once your desired currency has loaded, take note of the left-hand column which shows prices that people are willing to sell at in the top half in red and prices people are willing to buy at in green in the bottom half. The number in the middle shows the last sale price.

Now to place a buy order, use the center box underneath the graphs and you will see the buy box is in green on the right.

You can manually enter a price you wish to purchase at, but a better way is to click a number on the left-hand column.

You can then enter the amount of the currency you wish to buy or click the 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% buttons which will fill it with an amount based on how much of the buying currency you have ( in this case BTC ).

Once your order is placed it will be show underneath in the “Open Orders” section until it is filled.

At that point your new currency will be available under the “Deposits / Withdrawals” menu where you can withdraw it to the wallet of your choice.

Supported Crypto Currencies

Binance has often been praised for its wide variety of support coins. Traders can use the platform for multiple digital currencies, including, but not limited to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, EOS, Dash, LiteCoin, NEO, GAS, Zcash, Dash, Ripple and more.

As mentioned before, Binance also supports numerous tokens, as part of ICO listings. With this in mind, traders can use the platform to trade these tokens for a profit as well.

Binance is currently very quick to add new coins and tokens after their ICO which usually means you can purchase them cheaply which allows for greater profit down the road.

They currently offer trading pairs in BTC, BNB, ETH and USDT.

Binance ICO & BNB Coin

Another thing to note is the Binance Coin, which was issued during their own ICO. The Binance coin can be used to pay fees and it will also feature in their future plans to create a Decentralized Exchange where it will form one of the key base currencies.

Purchasing the Binance coin itself looks like a good investment for the future as the exchange plans to use their profits to buy back a portion of the coins every quarter and destroy them: hence decreasing the supply and making them more valuable for holders.

Every quarter, we will use 20% of our profits to buy back BNB and destroy them, until we buy 50% of all the BNB (100MM) back. All buy-back transactions will be announced on the blockchain. We eventually will destroy 100MM BNB, leaving 100MM BNB remaining.

If you’d like to read more about the BNB Coin, check out our indepth guide.

Binance Fees & Limits

At the time of writing, Binance charges an average fee of 0.1% on each trade that a user makes. Those who choose to pay via the Binance token can get a 50% discount on the trading fee, which is absolutely great news. These are surely some of the lowest fees available at this time.

Withdrawal fees tend to vary for each digital currency. For instance, 0.0005 is charged for Bitcoin withdrawals, and 0.005 is charged for ETH withdrawals. Here are some examples to give you an idea of the fees you will be paying for withdrawals:

COIN	CODE	Fee	Unit
Binance Coin	BNB	1	BNB
Bitcoin	BTC	0.001	BTC
Ethereum	ETH	0.01	ETH
Litcoin	LTC	0.01	LTC
Neo	NEO	Free	NEO
Qtum	QTUM	0.01	QTUM
Status	SNT	10	SNT
Bancor	BNT	1.2	BNT
Eos	EOS	0.7	EOS
Bitcoin Cash	BCC	0.0005	BCC
Gas	GAS	Free	GAS
USDT	USDT	50	USDT

 

When it comes down to transfer limits, there is no limit on the number of coins that you can deposit. However, without getting verified, users are limited in terms of how much they can withdraw.

Verification will establish you as a level two users, thus lifting these limits and providing a lot more freedom when using the platform.

The verification process requires users to provide Binance with their full name, country, gender, a photo of passport/government-issued ID, and even a selfie with the passport.

Is Binance Safe?

While Binance is one of the newest cryptocurrency exchanges available on the market, it has quickly managed to attain a high level of trust from its users and the digital currency community.

However, the exchange fails to provide users with enough information on how the funds are being secured, yet we like to believe that security is taken seriously. Two-factor authentication is available and is always a nice sight. It is however known that the platform offers a multi-tier and multi-tier system architecture.

Update: In March 2018 Binance suffered a hacking attempt.

The hackers tried to pull off an audacious move which was luckily caught by the automated systems in place at the exchange. For months the hackers had been accumulating people’s logins via a phishing website and secretly installing API access on the affected accounts.

They then struck, converting all the victims altcoins to BTC and purchasing Viacoin, pumping the coin to a huge price and then selling their own supply of Viacoin at the high point, before trying to withdraw the BTC to their own wallets. Luckily no one lost funds as the hack was caught and the only people to lose out were the hackers, whose funds will be donated to charity.

As this hack was made possible by people entering their site logins and 2FA details into a fake website, you should always make sure you are on the correct Binance url before logging in. We recommend you bookmark the site and only use that to access it, never click links from emails, Twitter, Telegram etc.

This event has done a lot to instill confidence around Binance, not only did their automated processes catch the attempted hack before anyone lost any funds, they have since offered a $250,000 bounty to anyone who can help catch the hackers. Throughout this event, Binance acted exemplary and have been praised for their swift action in resolving this.

Binance Customer Support

For an exchange to be successful, it requires a great customer support team, capable of answering all user questions and requests in a timely manner. While the support area on Binance could use a little work, the team is responsive and capable of offering professional aid to traders in need. Support tickets are submitted via an online form featured on the website, and responses are made via email. There is currently no live chat support, nor a phone number where customers can get in touch with the support team.

Other than the CS team, Binance offers a couple of FAQs and articles meant to help users get accustomed to the exchange and the way it works.

It should be noted that customer support on Binance has been known to be slow to respond to customer requests. This is a familiar phenomenon with most of large exchanges and is due simply to the volume of users and amount of support staff.

The exchanges have grown at an explosive rate this past year and the companies simply haven’t been able to keep up with demand. Binance grew fast especially, going from launch to the largest exchange on the planet in a few short months.

Support staff for exchanges have to be carefully vetted and trained due to the technicalities and security requirements involved – unlike other traditional companies where staff can be trained quicker.

Some things to bare in mind are double-checking wallet addresses, make sure you are sending the correct cryptocurrency to it’s corresponding address on the site. Mixups with wallets are one of the biggest mistakes people make when using exchanges.

Other things to note are, try a smaller test payment first if you plan to transfer large sums – it may cost you a little more in fees but will be worth it for peace of mind.

If you do need to contact support, make sure you provide them with enough information to be able to help you first time. Include wallet addresses, times of transactions and any other information you think they might need to help speed up the process.

The Move to Malta

In March 2018, Japanese Newspaper Nikkei reported that Binance was trading in Japan and not following their official regulations. This caused some turbulence in the markets until Binance made an official announcement that they were going to be moving operations to the crypto-friendly island of Malta in Europe, stating :

After reviewing several different locations, the company decided to invest in the European nation due to its existing pro-blockchain legislation and the stability that it offers financial technology companies through its regulatory framework.

This is good news for the company and they even received a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Malta on Twitter.

Binance also announced that they were in talks with Maltese banks with the goal of providing Fiat transactions, meaning they can offer an on-ramp for fiat to crypto transactions in future along with fiat trading pairs on the exchange.

More good news for Binance, it seems as their profile and reputation within the industry continues to grow.

Launching a Decentralized Exchange

More recent news for Binance and what seems like good news BNB holders is the fact that they are planning to launch their own Decentralized Exchange ( DEX ):

“After extensively researching decentralized exchange frameworks and analyzing existing implementations, we believe significant improvements can be made in providing Binance users with a level of trading experience to which they are already accustomed. Centralized and Decentralized exchanges will co-exist in the near future, complementing each other, while also having interdependence.”

The BNB digital asset, now an ERC-20 token, will migrate as the native token of that network and be used for paying the trading fees on the new exchange.

Launching a Decentralized Stock Exchange

More good news recently for Binance is that they are partnering with Neufund to build the world’s first Decentralized Stock Exchange.

Alongside the Malta Stock Exchange, they are aiming to create a regulated and decentralized, global stock exchange for listing and trading tokenized securities alongside crypto-assets.

According to CapLinked, the market cap of equity tokens alone is projected to reach $1 trillion by 2020 and thanks to the partnership with MSX, a subsidiary of the Malta Stock Exchange and Binance, Neufund will become the first end-to-end primary issuance platform for security tokens, in particular, equity tokens. It will secure ways for secondary trading of equity tokens and enable companies around the world to fundraise on Blockchain in a legal way while offering much-needed liquidity.

This is more positive news for Binance as they aim to consolidate their position as the world’s number one Crypto Exchange.

Binance Jersey Launch – Now Supports Fiat to Crypto

As of 16th January 2019, Binance has announced the launch of a new Fiat to Crypto exchange named “Binance Jersey“.

The trading platform is live and active and allows you to trade in fiat currencies such as euros and pound sterling, with Europe being their target market.

We have now carried out a full review of Binance Jersey, so take a look for more indepth details about the new platform.

At the time of writing they are only offering four trading pairs with more to follow soon:

Customers who wish to trade in the support fiat currencies will need to carry our KYC procedures by uploading their ID documents such as passport and driving license.

Wei Zhou, Binance’s CFO released this statement about the launch :

“Expanding the cryptocurrency exchange markets with fiat currencies in the European region is opening new economic opportunities for Europeans as well as freedom from looming Brexit uncertainty where the pound and euro are also in concern. Through Binance Jersey, we want to help bridge the crypto-fiat channel for Europe and the U.K. as part of our global expansion to support broader cryptocurrency adoption”.

If you are familiar with trading on Binance, then you will feel at home on their new exchange – it uses the same engine and the trading screen is laid out in the same fashion with the option to choose between Basic and Advanced views:

To fund your account in fiat, you will first need to complete the KYC process, once that is done you can then deposit funds directly from your bank account by linking it from the Deposits screen.

You can also fund your account with BTC or Ethereum. Once you have your account setup and bank account linked, you can also withdraw funds in fiat currency – this is great news as Binance is now able to offer a way for investors to cash out their cryptocurrencies.

We have upgraded our review scores below and we feel this is a huge improvement to Binance’s Exchange offering, if they manage to roll this out to even more countries ( USA is currently excluded) it could be a game changer as people now have an extra, regulated fiat on and off ramp for their holdings.

Buying Bitcoin with Australian Dollars

On March 20, 2019, Binance announced the launch of Binance Lite Australia, the continent’s first fiat gateway to the world of cryptocurrencies which provides a secure, reliable, and easy to use way to buy Bitcoin with cash in Australia.

The cash-to-Bitcoin brokerage service operates via a network of over 1,000 newsagents across Australia, and currently allows anyone to buy Bitcoin using Australian Dollars (AUD), and there are plans to include additional digital currencies and fiat purchasing options in the future.

Users must first undergo account verification on Binance Lite, and after being successfully verified, users can place online orders and deposit cash at their nearest newsagent, in order to receive their pre-ordered Bitcoin.

The Binance Lite brokerage service is operated by InvestbyBit, an independently operated subsidiary of the Binance.com cryptocurrency exchange. The service aims to simplify the process of purchasing cryptocurrencies and make digital assets such as Bitcoin readily accessible across Australia.

Fees A 2.5% transaction fee (50% discount applied) plus GST on the transaction fee for each purchase is currently being charged as an introductory rate. Therefore, for a $50 order, the transaction fee will be $1.22 and the GST will be 10% of the transaction fee, which is $0.12.
Limits The system is currently in its Beta phase, and the minimum purchase amount has been lowered to $30 with the maximum purchase amount capped at $1000. These limits may change over time and only multiples of $10 are being accepted, such as orders for $50, $60, $70 etc.
Verification

First time customers are required to go through a one-time Know Your Customer (KYC) document verification. When using the service, it’s necessary to follow the instruction prompts after the order page and go through the verification.

In order to complete the verification process, it’s necessary to submit 1 or 2 forms of government issued ID documents as a Passport, Driver’s Licence, or Medicare card, in addition to your residential address. Any returning customers, who have already completed KYC verification, will be sent to the order summary page directly after opening a new order.

Each account is linked to a mobile number, and users should ensure to use the mobile number provided when first completing the verification process. Anyone choosing to use a new mobile number will be required to complete the ID verification process once again.

Paying by Debit and Credit Card

Binance allows users to make debit and credit card payments for cryptocurrencies via a partnership with Simplex. It’s possible to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP tokens by Visa and MasterCard and the benefits of using a debit or credit card on Binance include:

Swift Transfers: Average 10-30 mins for cryptocurrency to reach your wallet
Low Fees: only 3.5% per transaction or 10 USD, whichever is higher
Convenient: Visa and MasterCard accepted

In order to purchase the supported cryptocurrencies with a debit or credit card, users can first go through the official instructions page and then visit: https://www.binance.com/en/creditcard.

Binance Launchpad and Initial Coin Offerings (IEOs)

Binance Launchpad is the exchange’s token launch platform that aims to connect blockchain projects with the greater cryptocurrency community and enable projects to raise funds while interacting with Binance’s significant user base.

In December 2017, the BREAD and GIFTO projects were able to hold successful token sales on Binance Launchpad and projects such as BitTorrent and Fetch.AI have also held successful launches in 2019.

The platform makes use of the exchange’s native BNB token and rewards users for holding the token as well as allowing it to be used to participate in token sales.

Read: What is an IEO?

How Token Offerings Work on Binance Launchpad

The ability to part in token offerings continues to attract a significant amount of users to Binance and it’s necessary to go through a number of steps in order to get used to the Launchpad platform.

Anyone interested in a project should first go to the Binance Launchpad website and click on the project page and thoroughly research any of the projects on offer.

If not already done, it’s also necessary to complete your Binance account verification, as token sales are carried out in compliance with the regulatory requirements in supported user jurisdictions.

The Lottery System

Binance Launchpad operates a lottery system which sees that the number of lottery tickets you can claim being dependant on the amount of BNB tokens you hold in your Binance account over a 20-day period leading up to the day of the lottery, with a maximum of up to 5 tickets per eligible account.

The 20 days leading up to the lottery draw date is represented by X below, and  by example, 100 ≤  X < 200 means that your BNB balance over the entire 20-day period is kept at 100 BNB or more, but does not exceed or reach 200 BNB.

A snapshot at 0:00 AM (UTC) each day records each user’s BNB balance, and should your BNB balance drop below the minimum balance required on any given day during the 20-day period, they will be put into the lower threshold.

For example, if User A holds 301 BNB for 19 of the 20 days but their balance drops to 299 BNB on one day. They will move to the lower threshold and only be eligible to claim 2 lottery tickets.

Before the actual lottery date, users are given a 24 hour period to select how many lottery tickets they wish to enter, with the maximum number based upon their BNB holdings over the previous 20 days.

Here, if a user submits an entry of 5 tickets and 2 tickets end up winning, they are committed to pay for 2 ticket allocations (in BNB) for the tokens.

Each lottery ticket has a unique number with multiple lottery ticket holders, obtaining tickets with consecutive numbers. For example, when claiming 5 tickets, the tickets may be numbered 100010, 100011, 100012, 100013 and 100014.

Once the 24 hour period ends and all tickets have been fully issued, Binance begins to randomly select multi-digit numbers. These are matched against the tail digits of all issued tickets in order to determine the list of winners.

The selection process continues until the maximum number of winners are matched, and the respective BNB is deducted from each winning user’s balance, as soon as they are deemed a winner.

Binance announces the maximum number of potential lottery ticket winners, and the allocation amount corresponding to each winning ticket in advance.

Binance Hack

At the start of May 2019, Binance suffered their first Hack which we covered here on Blockonomi. In short, a hacker was able to gain access and bypass some of their security measures using key user information, including API keys, used by trading bots and third-party portfolio managers.

They were able to withdraw over $40million worth of cryptocurrency from the exchange.

Binance decided to fully cover these losses using their “SAFU” security fund, and reimbursed all users of any losses they suffered.

The fact that Binance covered these losses, gives us more confidence in their honesty and integrity but also underlines the important fact that you should follow security best practices and only keep small amounts of crypto on exchanges.

Make use of Hardware wallets to store your funds securely as it seems even the biggest exchanges are not immune to this type of attack.

Conclusion

Currently, the matching engine of the exchange is capable of processing approximately 1.4 million orders each second, hence making it one of the fastest exchanges available on the market.

Additionally, the exchange works on all forms of devices, including web, Android, WeChat, and HTML5. Non-English speakers will be happy to know that Binance offers multiple-language support in Chinese, English, Korean and Japanese.

Based on everything that has been outlined so far, Binance is undoubtedly the leading Cryptocurrency Exchange and offers great fees and awesome digital currency support.

As it reportedly has access to abundant resources and partners, chances are that Binance will continue to evolve and offer great digital currency exchange services to its clients.

We are happy to recommend Binance and have added it to our list of the Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges.

We have continued to update this review since Binance was first launched ( we were one of the first to offer a review of the platform at the time ). And as time has progressed, time and time again Binance have proven to be one of the very best, if not the best, exchanges available.

Their CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ for short) has been part of the cryptocurrency community and shown high standards of integrity.

Binance the exchange has continued to innovate, bringing new products to market and new options for purchasing and trading cryptocurrencies to all corners of the globe.

Prime XBT Leverage


Contents [Show]

Leverage is one of the many features that advanced traders tend to look for, but most platforms offer very limited leverage when it comes to trading cryptocurrency. PrimeXBT stands out by offering leverage of 1:100.

This means that for each $1, you get $100 worth of buying or selling power. This essentially gives you access to a greater market position, so you can make even more profits, or indeed losses.

Leverage is one of the key features of PrimeXBT and among its main features. The website also offers a detailed explanation of leverage on its website to help those that do not fully understand.

This explanation includes an example with BTC/USD for example.

In this example, assume that Bitcoin is $10,000 each, and its price rose by 5 percent during your investment.
If you were to use a traditional exchange without leverage, you could buy 10 BTC for $100,000 (10 x $10,000).
If the price went up by 5 percent, your BTC would be worth $10,500 each so if you sell them, you will make $5,000 off of your $100,000 investment.

In contrast, if you were to make the same trade on PrimeXBT with its 1:100 leverage, you would only have to pay 1 percent of the $100,000 position, meaning an investment of $1,000 up front.

In the same situation, this means you would still make $5,000 but would have only invested $1,000. In other words, you can vastly multiply your profits with the same amount of initial capital.

PrimeXBT explains some of the advantages of trading with leverage, including the ability to magnify profits, gearing opportunities (the ability to free up capital you can use for another investment), and the ability to gain when the market falls.

There is also a convenient leverage calculator on PrimeXBT, so you can figure out your buying power based on your available capital.

Just keep in mind that while using leverage increases the potential reach of your funds and your potential profits, it will also increase the potential losses.

As such, you should always be cautious when using the maximum leverage offered on PrimeXBT. That being said, those with trading experience and confidence in their methods find leverage to be an incredibly useful tool.

Profiting From Market Movements

Since the cryptocurrency market does not always increase, PrimeXBT offers methods of profiting whether the market is going up or down. You can trade any of the most popular cryptocurrencies and hedge existing holdings or profit from rallies or declines in the market.

In other words, you can go either long or short with PrimeXBT. Buying is when you go long while selling is when you go short. To go long, you would buy Bitcoin and watch your account increase in value while the price of BTC rises.

In this case, a fall in BTC’s price would drop the value in your account. In contrast, you can go short, which means you open a position that will increase its value if the price of BTC goes down.

You can view specific examples with calculations for each of these types of trades on PrimeXBT. There is also information on calculating your profits, so you can understand what is going on in your account. To calculate your profit or loss, you just take the difference in price points at opening vs. closing and multiply this value by the size of the position. If you combine it with leverage, you can increase your position size.

Prime XBT Trading

In addition to the ability to go long or short and to enjoy leverage of up to 1:100, PrimeXBT stands out in multiple ways. It has a very user-friendly interface that fully customizable and includes support for multiple monitors.

The trading platform is a best-in-class option as it is safe, reliable, and fast. It is simple enough for beginners to understand yet includes the advanced tools that professional traders want.

The charting tools are particularly useful with various chart types, a range of drawing tools and indicators, and the option of trading right from the chart. PrimeXBT also offers very low trading fees. You will notice straightforward and low commission rates, so there are no surprises. Additionally, PrimeXBT offers tight spreads.

PrimeXBT Trading Platform

You can preview the live trading platform of PrimeXBT to get a feel for how it works before you open an account. The preview version of the platform is incredibly similar to the real version.

The only difference is in the very bottom section of the screen labeled “Positions.” If you have a live account, you would see a list of positions with the following columns for each: symbol, position ID, time and date, side, size, fill price, current price, take profit, stop loss, and P/L.

Since the preview version is not associated with an account, this section is blurred out and over it, you will find the option to log in or register.

Overall, the trading platform is exactly what you expect as it is very similar to the trading pages experienced investors are used to. On the top left side of the screen, you will see a list of cryptocurrency pairs.

These include LTC/USD, BTC/USD, ETH/USD, EOS/USD, and XRP/USD. For each, you can view the bid price, ask price, and change. These figures are color-coded in white, green, or red.

As expected, green indicates an increase while red indications a decrease.

Clicking on any of the pairs listed here will bring you to a screen that lets you buy or sell the crypto in question. It will display the prices for buying and selling as well as the low and high for the pair.

Below this section, still on the left of the screen, you will see the Order Book. The Order Book displays the information for whichever currency pair you most recently selected from the top left corner. It is divided into sales and purchases. A nice touch on this Order Book is that in addition to a list of the quantities and prices, it also displays a visual representation via graphs in green and red in the background. This way, you can see the current trends at a glance.

The main section of the trading page is the actual chart, which is directly to the right of the crypto listings and Order Book and takes up most of the page. The top left corner of the chart shows you the trading pair it represents.

You can adjust this by clicking on the box where it is listed and typing in the new pair (you will notice autofill suggestions) or by clicking on the pair to the left in the crypto listing section.

Trading Charts on PrimeXBT

The default setting of the PrimeXBT trading chart is a candlestick chart. It is color-coded green and red with prices on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. Hovering over any point on the chart will show you the specific date and time as well as the open, high, low, close, and value.

You can increase or decrease the time range displayed by adjusting the time graph immediately below the main chart. The top of the chart is where you will find most settings.

There is a drop-down menu that lets you change the intervals of the candlesticks. The default is 5 minutes, but you can also choose 1, 15, or 30 minutes; 1, 2, or 4 hours; or 1 day, week, or month. To the left of this is the option to switch from a candlestick chart to a line graph or bar graph.

Next to this, you will find options regarding crosshairs. You can also choose long or short and from a range of 13 indicators, lines, and tools to add. These include things like a trend line, trend channel, and Fibonacci Rays, among others.

Advanced traders will be interested in the Studies section, which is accessible via an icon of a test tube to the right of the above options and to the left of Studies. You can choose from one of several dozen available studies or add in your own study. Use up to five at once.

There are two methods of trading with PrimeXBT. You can click on a pair on the left of the page and fill in the box that appears. Or you can use the section at the top left corner of the chart, directly below the name of the pair.

PrimeXBT Fees & Limits

PrimeXBT charges two types of fees, trading and overnight finance. Because instruments are leveraged products you finance the traded value through an overnight financing.

This borrowing cost (financing) is dependent on the liquidity of the underlying asset. If you open and close a leveraged position within the same trading day, you are not subject to overnight financing.

Symbol	Trading fee	Financing/day Long	Financing/day Short
BTC/USD	0.05%	-$3.9 per 1 BTC	-$3.9 per 1 BTC
ETH/USD	0.05%	-$0.13 per 1 ETH	-$0.13 per 1 ETH
LTC/USD	0.05%	-$0.03 per 1 LTC	-$0.03 per 1 LTC
XRP/USD	0.05%	-$0.00038 per 1 XRP	-$0.00038 per 1 XRP
EOS/USD	0.05%	-$0.0025 per 1 EOS	-$0.0025 per 1 EOS

 

The exposure limit is a restriction on the size of a position each individual client can maintain with PrimeXBT. The trading platform will not allow clients to place orders which will exceed the limit if executed.

The restriction is set by the PrimeXBT risk management department and depends on such factors as instrument liquidity, volatility and other market conditions.

Symbol	Min. order size	Min. order size change	Max. single trade size	Max. exposure
BTC/USD	0.01 BTC	0.01 BTC	15 BTC	-$3.9 per 1 BTC
ETH/USD	0.01 ETH	0.01 ETH	200 BTC	-$0.13 per 1 ETH
LTC/USD	0.01 LTC	0.01 LTC	650 LTC	-$0.03 per 1 LTC
XRP/USD	1 XRP	0.01 XRP	55000 XRP	-$0.00038 per 1 XRP
EOS/USD	1 EOS	0.01 EOS	8500 XRP	-$0.0025 per 1 EOS
Conclusion

PrimeXBT have created a solid offering in the crowded cryptocurrency trading space.

The trading platform is easy to use, and PrimeXBT stands out from the competition with its low commissions, tight spreads, and class-leading leverage of 1:100. The exchange officially opened last year and has gone on to cement a good reputation in the industry.

As with all types of exchanges that offer leverage, we would advise you to proceed cautiously if you haven’t traded in this manner before. It’s quite easy to get things wrong and end up being liquidated and losing your cryptocurrency in this way, especially if you are employing a high amount of leverage.

We have updated this review for 2020 and are now much more confident in recommending them to our readers.

As such, Bitsgap has evolved to accommodate the many needs and expectations of cryptocurrency traders.

In this Bitsgap review, we explore everything there is to know about the cross-exchange services offered by the provider.

Bitsgap at a Glance

Contents [Show]

Bitsgap is advertised as a new way to trade across multiple exchanges, by finding the best rates and effectively managing your portfolio. The platform allows you to bring all of these elements under one roof, providing access from a single account at the click of a button. It has carefully designed features that will enable you to:

Quickly compare rates from heaps of digital currency markets
Trade and instantly switch between different exchanges
Keep track of your investments
Basic and advanced order types
Take advantage of the price difference between exchanges using arbitrage
Test your strategies out via a demo account facility without risking any capital

Currently, Bitsgap is integrated with 30 exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, Bitfinex, and more. Traders have access to 10,000+ cryptocurrency trading pairs and several technical indicators available to formulate your strategies. The platform offers an optimised and intuitive interface for both beginners and seasoned traders.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this free trial to understand how the platform works before you opt-in for a paid version.

Basic Plan at $19 a Month

The basic account comes with all standard features and allows you to engage in unlimited exchanges. However, there is a trading limit of $25,000.

You also get access to your cross-exchange portfolio, and can set up trading signals and extended order types. The demo trading option is also available together with two active automated trading bots.

Advanced Plan at $44 a Month

This account gives you all perks of the basic plan, with a $100,000 monthly trading limit. There is also a boost in the number of active trading bots from 2 to 5. In addition, you can also benefit from the Bitsgap arbitrage services.

Pro Plan at $110 a Month

The Pro Plan is most suited for traders who are looking for unlimited limits across unlimited exchanges. You can also set up 15 active bots to trade in live market conditions. Pro Plan owners will also receive priority support.

Note: Bistgap does not charge any fees for any trades. All of its services are included in the monthly subscription fee. Any fees on transactions are imposed by the respective exchange you are trading on.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

Another major plus is the wealth of resources made available on the platform, and the Support Section contains a number of guides, and FAQs that help people get to grips with the most important issues.

Furthermore, the team maintain a blog that details a number of key concepts for newer traders, and also provide further assistance via their Telegram group, YouTube Channel, and other social media channels, and members can gain access to the 3Commas Discord from inside their accounts.

"Avast Secureline VPN Review: Complete Beginner’s Guide","In today’s fast-paced online world, you need a VPN to hide your identity from hackers, and the snooping gaze of…","In today’s fast-paced online world, you need a VPN to hide your identity from hackers, and the snooping gaze of your internet service provider. Using a VPN is the safe way of browsing the internet; without it, your computer risks attack from online criminals.

Avast is well-known for its free antivirus software that does an average job of protecting your computer from malware and viruses. The company recently acquired one of the world’s leading VPN firms, “HideMyAss!” As a result, it wasn’t long before Avast decided to launch their VPN product, powered by the proven technology of HideMyAss! systems.

Avast Secureline is a solid VPN product from an established name. If you’re in need of a low-cost VPN than provides solid performance, the Avast SecureLine is a good option to consider for protection while surfing the web.

Typically, VPN providers promise the world and then they don’t deliver, with download speeds being the most significant drawback to running a network, So how does the offering from Avast compare? We decided to unpack the Avast SecureLine VPN to give you a deeper dive into what these piece of software can offer you.

Avast SecureLine Pricing Options and Plans

Let’s get down to the money side of things straight away, and then you can make a judgment call at the end of this review to determine whether purchasing Avast SecureLine is worth your hard-earned cash.

Every other VPN provider charges a flat fee for their subscription service, regardless of what device you’re using. These providers typically offer 1-month, quarterly or annual plans, with a sliding discount scale if you sign up for longer-term contracts.

However, Avast took a different approach with SecureLine, offering the software at price points depending on the type and number of devices you’ll be using with the VPN. The standard pricing model looks like this;

The best value package on offer for SecureLine is $79.99 per year for access to 5 devices. ($6.67 per month or $16 p/year for each device on the plan.
Access to Avast SecureLine for Mac or P.C. is $59.99 per year. ($5 per month for access to one computer.)
Access to SecureLine for iPhone or Android devices is $19.99 per year. ($1.67 per month for access to one device.)

If you’re hesitant about spending your money on an untested product, then we suggest you look into the free “no-strings-attached” 7-day trial for the software. Unlike other providers, you don’t need to enter your credit card details to gain access to the VPN.

If you do decide to get onboard with Avast Secureline, then you can pay through Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal. There is no option for payment with cryptocurrency or alternative payments systems like Perfect Money.

Considering this program has very few features, and average performance, we are surprised to see that Avast prices their product along the lines of other VPNs on offer from Private Internet Access and NordVPN. When it comes down to cost versus functionality, it appears that Avast doesn’t have a winning combination in this case.

Refund Policy

If you look through the fine print, you’ll notice that Avast offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for their product. However, closer inspection of the terms and conditions of the promise reveal loopholes that you need to be aware of before you purchase the VPN.

Avast has a clause in their T&C’s that states your refund amount is subject to your usage of the program during the 30 days. Should you connect more than 100-times, or upload or download more than 10GB of data through the VPN, then you forfeit your money-back guarantee.

If you’re a heavy user of bandwidth, you might want to consider this information before starting your trial.

Privacy & Logging

Privacy is the top concern of many people when purchasing a VPN, and it’s the reason why they are looking at VPNs in the first place. Looking at the security and privacy features of the software, we find that there is no kill switch, no control over your protocol settings, and no customizable leak protection technology.

However, Avast does run the highly secure and award-winning OpenVPN protocol, which runs on AES-256-CBC, making it very reliable when it comes to protecting your privacy. While the lack of features may sound disappointing, it’s not as devastating as it seems. Avast covers the basics with SecureLine, preventing WebRTC and DNS leaks which may give hackers or prying eyes some clues about our online escapades.

When it comes to logging, Avast claims that they do not record your browsing history, they do not store the details of any sites you visit or monitor any of your activity. However, further reading into the document uncovers the following policy statement on session logging.

‘We will store a time stamp and I.P. address when you connect and disconnect to our VPN service, the amount of data transmitted (up- and download) during your session together with the I.P. address of the individual VPN server used by you.’ – quoted directly from the source.

While this condition may not matter to you if your only watching YouTube videos and surfing through your favorite blogs, it’s an issue if you download torrents. Anyone looking into I.P.’s of people downloading torrents may end up with them connecting your activity back to your Avast SecureLine account.

Navigating SecureLine

We were pleasantly surprised when Avast didn’t prompt us to enter our credit card information to download the free trial – and they didn’t require an email address either. We found the software easy to install and has an excellent interface.

It’s clear that Avast designed their software with the novice in mind. When opening the software for the first time, the system prompts you with arrows to let you become accustomed to connecting and switching servers. The system also provides captions informing you of each of the feature’s functions and how to use them.

SecureLine presents you with notifications to let you know when it’s connecting and if it goes offline. While this is an essential tool to help people understand if they are protected or not, we were reasonably annoyed to find that the software does not send notifications through Windows, but rather through its independent pop-up window.

When the notification appears, and you’re in the middle of another task, like writing your shopping list on a note pad, then you won’t be able to continue typing until your check the prompt box in the notification – we can’t tell you enough how irritating this is for our productivity. Fortunately, there’s a setting that allows you to turn off notifications, but then you won’t know if the client is working or offline.

The location picker for SecureLine lets you swap between sever locations by filtering by continent – which is a useful feature. However, there no indication of ping time or server load to help you select the best sever location. SecureLine also has no functionality for speeding up the process of reconnecting to servers.

The settings for SecureLine also yield a similar story. We enjoy the automatic connectivity when you’re accessing unsecured Wi-Fi networks, but there isn’t much else on offer. You have no option to tweak or change the protocol from OpenVPN, as well as no kill switch, and no DNS settings.

The SecureLine access tray also leaves a lot to be desired, with no option to quickly change between servers without opening the client. If you want to use another server other than the default option, then you need to open the client and click multiple times to change to another location.

Some VPN providers only offer their products for use on P.C. or Mac products. However, with Avast SecureLine, you get protection for your iPad and phone as well. SecureLine is available for Android and iPhone or iPad devices.

When we decided to give the Android app a try, we found it had much of the same interface as the desktop client, with no additional features. There is also no option to filter server locations by continent in the app, and no recent server list to help to speed up your reconnections.

One of the features we did enjoy was the way the software connects to a VPN server whenever it detects any other network other than your specified secure list, even when you’re using a mobile device.

Overall, the software works and protects you while browsing, but it lacks any of the additional features available with other clients that cost the same amount of money.

Avast Secureline Performance

Avast SecureLine doesn’t have OpenVPN configuration files available for its users, meaning you’ll need to run manual performance tests to check for connection speeds. We used SpeedTest.net and Fast.com to check our connectivity information.

We found that download speeds in the United Kingdom to be the best performing server group on offer with SecureLine. Our tests show speeds of between 50-60Mbps on our 75Mbps line. Using other server locations throughout Europe in Germany, Netherlands, France, and Sweden all produce similar results in terms of download speed and ping rates.

Speeds in the United States met our expectations, with average speeds of between 35Mbps on the West coast, and the East coast was coming in with faster speeds between 50 to 55Mbps. We found that all other European server locations produced undesirable speeds of between 10 to 25Mbps, with Poland offering a dismal 13Mbps.

However, going international produces interesting results, with Malaysia returning a laughable 1.3Mbps, while Australia offered speeds of between 25 to 40-Mbps.

Overall, we have to say that we are impressed by the download speeds on offer through the SecureLine software. While it lacks feature, frills, bells, and whistles, the software gets the job done, and doesn’t reduce browsing speed unless you’re using sever locations outside of the U.S. or Europe.

Some Drawbacks We Found

Every piece of software has its benefits and drawbacks, and SecureLine is no different. There are a few cons of using this software; here is what we didn’t like about Avast SecureLine.

No Support Chat

We see this as the biggest drawback in the SecureLine after-sales strategy. There is no direct support line where you can chat to a live support consultant. Almost every other VPN provider we looked at offered their customers this basic functionality.

Fortunately, Avast has a forum with dedicated moderators that are always on call to field your questions. Post your problem with SecureLine in the appropriate forum, and you’ll probably get an answer to your issue in a few hours.

Lacking in Features

We have moaned about this problem throughout the duration of this review, but its something that we feel Avast need to work on to improve the product. A few tweaks would be all it takes to make this VPN one of the best available in the marketplace.

The notifications and lack of user-friendly server connection are our primary gripes with this software, and the lack of control also irritates us as well.

We would really like to see Avast add other features to this VPN. Port forwarding, kill-switches, and ad-blocking will all go a long way to enhancing the value and appeal of SecureLine. If you want basic protection, and control is not an issue for you, then Avast is the ideal VPN. However, if you do need control over your settings, then it’s probably better if you go with another service provider instead.

No Router Support

We like setting up our VPN on a router. By adopting this VPN strategy, you protect any device that connects to your Wi-Fi network at home or the office. However, SecureLine does not offer this functionality, and it’s clear that they intend SecureLine to be an independent VPN for desktop and mobile devises only.

The lack of this feature is not a deal-breaker by any means, but it’s a functionality that would significantly improve our impression of the software if it was available.

Number of Server Locations

Avast maintains servers in 34 countries around the world. However, the geographically diverse server locations do not offer much in the way of server or country choices to the user. While this is not bad, it’s not outstanding either, and we are surprised that Avast can maintain such decent levels of connectivity and download speed, considering their dearth of servers.

Therefore, if you reside in the United States of the U.K., we think that SecureLine will cover your needs. However, if you live outside of these countries, or frequently travel to other regions of the world, then your speed may slow significantly.

Encrypted & Secure

Avast SecureLine runs an OpenVPN AES-256 encryption. This level of encryption is considered military grade, and Avast offers two protocols to users, IPSec and OpenVPN. 256 is the leading level of encryption trusted by governments and business around the world.

Avast SecureLine also offers DNS leak protection for their clients. This functionality prevents leaks of your personal data from the network into the public domain where hackers might gain access to your details.

Torrenting Is Allowed

Unlike many other VPN providers, Avast SecureLine allows torrent downloads. According to information in the terms and conditions, Avast state that they allow peer-to-peer connectivity through their server locations listed below.

Frankfurt, Germany
Prague, Czech Republic
Amsterdam, Netherlands
New York City, New York
Seattle, Washington
Miami, Florida
Paris, France
London, United Kingdom
SecureLine Netflix & Streaming Support

The Avast VPN terms of service state that it only operates 4-servers that are “optimized for streaming.” As a result, you can only watch streamed content by accessing their U.K., Miami, New York, and “Gotham City.”

We decided to put SecureLine to the test and try to watch geoblocked content on our favorite platforms. Starting with accessing U.S. YouTube, we were surprised to find that the service only offered full functionality through the New York server, and we had no issue streaming YouTube clips.

We remained logged into the New York server and tried to access Netflix. We experienced no difficulty streaming Netflix content, which can be a concern with some providers since Netflix often blocks new I.P.’s

Customer Support

If it’s one thing Avast does not do very well, its run a support desk for their customers. The Avast support site is an indispensable resource for anything to do with internet security and privacy. The site has plenty of troubleshooting guides, as well as articles and guides on setting up and usage.

However, most of the support information on the site is related to Avast’s other products, with only basic information available about SecureLine. We think this may be because SecureLine is new and they are still developing the product – or maybe there is not enough material to dedicate an entire section to SecureLine.

Avast offers only 15-articles on SecureLine, in three categories –  Purchase and subscription, basic usage, and technical issues. Many of these articles contain information unrelated to your use of SecureLine, such as creating an account or GDPR Compliance. The site does offer a useful FAQ segment with topics relevant to running SecureLine.

If you can’t find what you want on the site, then you can fill out a support request ticket, and someone on the support team will get back to you within 48-hours. Alternatively, you can visit the Avast security forum in the SecureLine section. Most of these threads have useful information that may help in your troubleshooting.

No Adware or Malware Found in Trial Software

We’re sure you had prior experience of downloading a free software package that ended up installing malware on your computer. Many free offerings by companies are nothing more than data-collection tools designed to hijack your browser and redirect your navigation.

We can’t stand these types of software offerings, and that why we ran SecureLine through VirusTotal.com to check for any malicious code before we executed the installation on pour machine and mobile devices.

A VPN is supposed to keep you safe from downloading malicious files, not install them on your machine. Fortunately, Avast SecureLine contains no hidden malware or adware code that we could find in our search.

Wrapping Up – The Verdict

After exhaustively testing and reviewing Avast SecureLine, we reach our conclusion on this software. Before we bring you our verdict, we want to run down a brief look at the pros and cons of this VPN.

Pros

SecureLine offers an easy-to-use service.
Easy set-up, navigation, and use.
Excellent performance when compared to other competing products.
Low-cost license for people with one device.
Trustworthy provider – Avast Free Antivirus is well-known as one of the best free antivirus software for your desktop, laptop, or phone

Cons

Minimal features.
It works with official apps only.
Limited access to support.

We would like to see more features added to SecureLine before we hand over our money for a subscription. However, if you’re in the market for a VPN, and you care about functionality more than features, then we think Avast SecureLine will work well for you.

There are other options available to you, and we think it’s worth your while to check out what other competitors are offering before you commit to purchasing Avast SecureLine. However, if you only have one P.C. or laptop, then it may be worth considering using Avast SecureLine due to the savings on offer.

The speed and connectivity of the software is outstanding when compared to other VPN operators, but the lack of features may put some people off. So if you are in market for basic, but fast, connectivity then Avast Secureline is worth taking a look at.

Why You Need A VPN

A decade or so ago, VPNs were an obscure technology that no-one really understood the importance of for browsing or downloading online. It wasn’t until the recent privacy breaches of companies, and the advent of hackers stealing people’s personal information from open Wi-Fi networks, that people started to wake up to the importance of using a VPN.

Today a VPN is an essential tool for surfing the web. Without it, you may as well be walking down the street naked with a bulls eye on your chest. Internet security and privacy is a growing concern among people who use the internet daily. Securing your data is vital if you want to go online, and surfing without a VPN covering your I.P. could land you in big trouble.

A VPN bounces your I.P. address around a group of servers, continually changing the I.P. so that the site does not get a lock on your location. Using a VPN helps to prevent you from becoming a victim of cybercrime, and ensures that you can enjoy a risk-free internet experience.

Website Feel and Transparency

Before signing up for a CyberGhost account, take your time to have a look around their website. While the site itself won’t provide you with any protection, it’s a useful way of getting to know the company and its history, to give you a feel of their values.

Great companies build outstanding products, and the site is an example of another user-friendly experience on offer from the company. It’s easy to navigate the platform to find the relevant information you need, and the “Server Overview,” provides you with a real-time view of the active servers currently online.

The website has all its subscription packages on display, allowing users to compare pricing and features in each of the Free, Premium, and Premium Plus versions of the VPN subscription.

We appreciate that CyberGhost is open with their publicly transparent report page outlining any malicious activity on their servers. It also lists law enforcement notices, as well as DMCA and government requests.

User Interface and Features

After downloading and installing your CyberGhost VPN, you’ll notice how the interface is well-thought out, offering users smooth navigation. The user-friendly interface makes installation a snap, and connecting the client to a new I.P. address is a simple process.

Some of the features and functionality of CyberGhost include;
The ability to unblock streaming websites.
Protection for your Wi-Fi or internet connection.
Download torrents and browse anonymously.
Server Range and Locations

CyberGhost runs a server network in 58 countries all over the world, with locations in Northern America and Northern Europe providing the bulk of the operations. CyberGhost does run services in the Southern hemisphere, with servers in South Africa, South America, and Australia.

Within your settings, you can select servers and view their information to see if they allow for specific tasks, such as browsing, P2P, or streaming.

CyberGhost is rapidly expanding its network throughout the world, adding new locations all the time.

Account Set Up

Setting up a CyberGhost account involves a quick and efficient onboarding process. You decide on the subscription package you want and make your purchase. On the following screen, your download begins automatically.

CyberGhost email you the login information, and after installing the software, you enter your details, and the system pulls you through to your dashboard. The system creates a password automatically, and its best to change this as soon as possible.

CyberGhost also sends you a special key to help you access your account, be sure to store it in a secure folder.

Streaming – Does CyberGhost Work with Netflix?

Netflix is approaching 150-million global users, making it one of the most popular forms of online entertainment in many countries around the world. People living outside of the U.S. that want to each geoblocked content on Netflix, require a VPN to disguise their I.P.

CyberGhost has dedicated servers that specialize in streaming Netflix, and you can access these servers by clicking on the “for streaming” tab in the interface. However, when we logged on to the server, it would not let us access the site. Strangely, we found that logging onto a U.S. server solves this problem, and we were able to watch U.S. Netflix content without any issues.

All of the CyberGhost subscription plans come with unlimited bandwidth, which reduces issues with buffering while streaming. The app also features an ad-blocker that stops any pop-ups and mid-roll ads.

CyberGhost VPN also allows access to Hulu, HBO GO, and BBC iPlayer, enabling users to overcome geoblocks.

CyberGhost Speeds

One of the biggest gripes about using a VPN is a drop in download speed. A VPN forces your connection through a tunnel that slows it down somewhat. Depending on the strength of the VPN network, you could experience reductions of speed that are more than 90-percent from some server locations.

When logging into your CyberGhost account, we recommend you test the speed of the servers in Northern America and Europe first. Open SpeedTest.net and run a speed test on each of the server locations. We found that we received around a 5 to a 10-percent drop in our download speeds for North America and Europe, and the results for South-east Asia servers were poor.

It’s for this reason that its best to connect to a server near your current location. The further the data has to travel from the server to your computer, the slower your speed. Having a lightning-fast connection also helps to mitigate some of the drop-offs in download speed, but you will never be able to achieve the same download speeds through a VPN as you would with your standard connection.

If you want to view geoblocked content, then you’ll need to connect to the server in the country of the content source. For example, if you wish to log into the U.S. Netflix, then you will need to log into a North American server for access to the content.

Australian users will benefit from using CyberGhost VPN to view U.S. content, as we measured speeds of over 10-Mbps download and 0.77-Mbps upload, with a ping of 22 ms. That’s a fast connection speed for the other side of the planet!

Is CyberGhost Good for Torrenting?

Unlike other VPN providers that ban torrent downloads, CyberGhost offer access to dedicated servers for downloading torrents in many different countries. The app also lets you view how many other CyberGhost clients are using the same server.

CyberGhost offers port forwarding so you can upload your files, and the stability and speed of the app provide a smooth, buffer-free download of your favorite torrents.

Security – Is CyberGhost Safe?

The industry-leading security features available in the CyberGhost VPN app include a no logs policy, 256-bit military-grade encryption, and an internet kill-switch. To crack the encryption on offer from CyberGhost VPN, hackers would need 50-supercomputers checking billions of AES keys every second, and it would still take billions of years for the hackers to crack the encryption.

After the acquisition of CyberGhost by Kape Technologies, people began to question CyberGhosts integrity for keeping their data safe.

The Israeli firm, Kape Technologies has the previous accusation of hiding malware in its software bundles which is defintely a cause for concern. However, CyberGhost is yet to experience any security breaches, and their customers generally leave excellent reviews online. The level of their reputation in the marketplace as one of the best VPNs is enough to convince us that they are a trustworthy VPN provider.

Does CyberGhost Keep Logs?

One of the essential functions of a VPN provider is that they keep your online search history private. Some VPNs claim that they do not track the sites you visit and the content you download. However, in reality, they do keep logs of sessions and will give you information to authorities if subpoenaed.

CyberGhost has its head office in Romania, which is not a signatory to the “14-Eyes Alliance.” Therefore, they have no regulatory duty to keep any logs of your online activity for law enforcement purposes.

Does CyberGhost Have a Malware and Adblocker?

Log into your CyberGhost account and click on the “connection features” tab. The software presents you with options to turn on your adware and malware blocker to prevent ads from popping up while you’re browsing the internet.

CyberGhost also has an anti-malware feature that scans all sites you visit for malware infections that may hijack your browser. This feature allows CyberGhost to block you from accessing these unsecured sites before hackers can steal your data.

No-Spy Servers

If you’re frequently downloading torrents, the CyberGhost offers a No-spy” premium package that allows you to connect directly to a dedicated data center managed by CyberGhost employees.

The no-spy servers feature top-quality hardware, more bandwidth, and dedicated uplinks, for enhanced speeds. The additional protection keeps you even safer while carrying out risky activities like downloading torrent files.

Price and Value for Money

After reviewing the features and functionality of CyberGhost, it’s time to analyze their subscription offerings and see if they offer a value-for-money service.

Does CyberGhost Have a Free Version?

CyberGhost offers new users a free trial of their VPN for 24-hours. Considering most other companies providing VPN products have either a 3 or 7-day free trial, we think that 24-hours is a bit short.

However, it’s a smart marketing strategy on the part of CyberGhost. By giving their prospective customers the idea that they have a limitation on their trial, they are more likely to implement it and give it a try sooner than if they have a week to use it in their browsing activity.

After using CyberGhost for a few hours, you’ll be in a position to decide whether or not the software works for you. You have a full day to test the steaming, unblocking, and Torrenting functionality and the chances are that you’ll want a subscription af6ter you try it out for the first time.

CyberGhost’s Refund Policy

CyberGhost backs its reputation as one of the best VPNs available, with a 45-day money-back guarantee. If CyberGhost does not meet your expectations, then you have the option to cancel and receive a refund. However, it’s important to note that if you do ask for a refund, it may take 7 to 10-working days before the money shows in your bank account.

CyberGhost backs all of its plans with a no-questions-asked, 45-day money-back guarantee. If for any reason the service doesn’t match your needs, you can request a refund through its live chat service during this period.

Is CyberGhost Compatible with My Device?

CyberGhost will work with any desktop or mobile device. The software is compatible with Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android devices, and it also works with Amazon’s Fire T.V. Stick, and it features browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome as well.

CyberGhost also has installation guides on their site which provide you with information on setting up your VPN on routers, as well as other operating systems like Chrome O.S., Linux, Synology NAS, Raspberry Pi, and VU+ Solo 2.

CyberGhost also allows you to connect up to 7-devices to your account, making it one of the more generous service providers available.

Special Safety Features with CyberGhost

The team at CyberGhost do everything they can to ensure that you remain as safe and secure as possible while browsing and downloading content. Here are a few of the additional safety features of the software that make it stand out from its competitors.

Automated HTTPS Redirect and Online Tracking Blocker

The automatic HTTPS redirect allows your device to connect to the most secure version of each site you browse. This feature enables you to avoid unsafe sites with malware and phishing scams waiting to infect your browser.

Most websites have tracking cookies that install into your browser when visiting their site. These cookies track your movements around the web and report them back to the source site. CyberGhost automatically scans sites for these tracking cookies, blocking them from installing in your browser while alerting you to the threat.

CyberGhost Customer Service

It may be an industry-wide trend, but it seems like CyberGhosts customer service is on par with most other providers – in the sense that it is less than stellar. The app offers a live-chat with support consultants who try to help walk you through fixing any problems you have with the product.

However, if you’re calling for slow speeds, it feels like they are more concerned with customer retention than with solving your problem. We tried reaching out to the support desk and received an online support chat with a consultant when we couldn’t log into the U.S. Netflix site.

However, the consultant seemed confused about what we were trying to do and kept replying with general information on CyberGhosts functions and features that made it feel like we were talking to a chatbot.

We think that you may have better luck finding a solution to your problem on the FAQ page, rather than reaching out to a support consultant.

User Experience

CyberGhost offers a balanced approach to its user interface that makes the software easy to navigate for beginners. At the same time, the advanced features on offer will satisfy the needs of expert VPN users as well.

The clean layout on offer through the interface is user-friendly, and it’s no hassle to find and configure your connection settings. We like the “Smart Rules Window,” where you have the opportunity to customize your level of protection by setting rules for your connection, such as auto-connect on startup.

When connecting to CyberGhost, you have the option of manually selecting your server, or you can let the system pick the server that’s offering the best connection speeds for your location. The default on the software is to look for the closest server, so if you want to view geoblocked content, then you’ll need to choose your server before connecting.

We decided to make a list of the pros and cons of using CyberGhost; here are our results.

Pros

OpenVPN, PPTP, and L2TP-IPSec protocols.
Internet kill switch available.
Unlimited bandwidth and high speeds.
More than 3,600-servers on the global network.
45-day money-back guarantee.
I.P. and DNS leak protection.
Compatible with mobile devices and routers.
No logs policy and 256-bit, military-grade encryption.
Connect up to 7-devices on one account.

Cons:

Support is weak, but this seems to be the same for most VPN providers.
The monthly plan is higher than most other top-drawer VPN providers.
Subscription Costs

CyberGhost is a premium VPN on offer at premium prices. This VPN is one of the best products in the market, and they are not afraid to charge for their services. CyberGhost offers its subscription packages in three tiers.

3 Years – $2.75 per month.
1 Year – $5.99 per month.
1 Month – $12.99 per month.
Free trial – 24-hours.

It’s important to note that if you select the annual and quarterly plans, then the company will deduct the full amount from your credit card or payment service to unlock your account. People that sign up for the monthly account should be aware that CyberGhost automatically renews the payment at the end of the billing period.

You can pay for your subscription using MasterCard, Visa, Amex, PayPal, or Bitcoin- making it one of the few VPNs that takes payment through cryptocurrency. Paying with bitcoin is also the best option for privacy, as CyberGhost does not store any of your payment details, such as your credit card number.

Wrapping Up the Review – Is CyberGhost Worth It?

After testing out the service extensively, we are confident about recommending this piece of software to you. The VPN has all of the features you would expect from a premium brand product and more.

With a no-logs policy and 256-bit encryption, CyberGhost will keep you safe while you download Torrents, stream movies, or carrying out day to day browsing activities.

The subscription fee is in line with other top VPN providers, and we recommend going for the 3-year subscription. The 3-year deal offers the best value for your money, and at less than 10-cents a day, it represents good value for money.

CyberGhost performed better than we expected it to – especially in the speed department. We were expecting a significant drop in download speeds when using the software. However, we were pleased to find that in some cases, the program showed no signs of slow-down. This speed is something we have never experienced with any other VPN, and it’s the stand-out feature of using this software.

The customer support was the biggest let-down for us, and we still can’t get over the fact that CyberGhost may be using chatbots instead of real people for managing their support chat online.

The software is easy to install and ready to run in a few minutes after your purchase, and it’s easy to navigate for beginners to VPN services. We would put CyberGhost in the same category as NordVPN and Private Internet Access, as one of the leading VPN products available.

"BearTax Review: Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency Tax Software With Automated Calculations","So, you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency investor that has placed hundreds, if not thousands of trades over the past 12 months.…","So, you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency investor that has placed hundreds, if not thousands of trades over the past 12 months. While this is likely to be a logistical nightmare for your tax reporting endeavors – this doesn’t matter, because cryptocurrency profits are not taxed, right?

Wrong!

On the contrary – while the specific tax treatment of cryptocurrency trading will vary from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction, a significant number of tax authorities now require you to include cryptocurrency capital gains within your tax return.

As such, it is absolutely fundamental that you get your cryptocurrency taxes in order – otherwise, you could be getting a rather demanding letter from your local tax authority. Ultimately, tax evasion is a serious crime regardless of where you are based, which is why it might be worth considering an automated cryptocurrency tax platform like BearTax.

The platform allows you to track all of your cryptocurrency trades in an autonomous manner, meaning the underlying software will provide a breakdown of your profits and losses – and crucially – how much you owe to the taxman.

Fancy finding out whether or not the crypto-centric software provider is right for you? If so, be sure to read our in-depth BearTax Review.

What is BearTax?

Contents [Show]

In a nutshell, BearTax is an online platform that offers cryptocurrency portfolio tracking services – with the view of ascertaining your overall profits and losses.

In doing so, this makes it a seamless process when it comes to filing your annual tax returns. BearTax does this through an innovative API-based algorithm that links up with your chosen cryptocurrency exchanges. This includes the likes of Binance, Gemini, KuCoin, Coinbase – and many others.

The BearTax Homepage

The overarching selling point of BearTax is that it makes the impossible possible. By this, we mean it not only solves the woes of attempting to calculate your cryptocurrency capital gains in dollars and cents, but it also allows you to assess what taxes you are likely to owe.

Without utilizing a software platform to do this for you, endless hours of manual work would be required.

Rarely do exchanges give you a full breakdown of how much you’ve made or lost in fiat currency – which is what tax authorities like the IRS are interested in. These issues are further amplified if you’re a day trader, or an investor utilizing automated high-frequency software. As such, the only way around this is to perform a highly manual and cumbersome calculation process.

Once the financial year has concluded – and you’ve got all of your cryptocurrency profits and losses merged into a single portal – BearTax then allows you to download your tax documents automatically.

Alternatively – if you need to include your cryptocurrency gains with other areas of tax (such as property tax or income tax), the platform allows you to link your data with third-party software programs like TurboTax.

How Does BearTax Work?

The process of using BearTax for your cryptocurrency tax needs is super-easy. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to do.

Step 1: Create an Account

To get the ball rolling, you’ll need to head over to the BearTax homepage and create an account. This will require you to enter some personal information, as well as choose a username and password.

BearTax Signup Page
Step 2: Connect Cryptocurrency Exchanges

Once you’ve got your account set-up, you will be required to connect your cryptocurrency exchange accounts with BearTax. This is a fairly straightforward process, although the specifics can vary from exchange-to-exchange.

Moreover, you’ll have the option of allowing BearTax to track your trades automatically, or you can upload the required data as and when you choose to.

If opting for the former, you will need to link your cryptocurrency exchange API with BearTax. You’ll typically find this within your exchange account settings. Once you’ve found it, copy the long string of characters and then paste them into BearTax.

If opting for the manual process, or your chosen exchange does not support API integration, you will need to upload a CSV document into BearTax. You’ll get this by downloading it from your cryptocurrency exchange.

Connect your Exchanges via API or CSV upload
Step 3: Assess Your Profits and Losses

Whether you decide to do this on a regular basis – or only when tax time comes around, BearTax allows you to calculate your overall profits and losses for a pre-defined period.

It will then provide the required information for you to file your taxes with your respective authority.

Automatically calculate profit and loss on every transaction
What Exchanges is BearTax Compatible With?

In effect, BearTax is compatible with every cryptocurrency exchange in the market. However, the specific reporting method will depend on the exchange you are using. In terms of utilizing the API link-up or CVS upload, this is supported by more than 50 exchange platforms.

This includes all of the “big-boys”, such as Binance, Coinbase, Bittrex, Gemini, Poloniex, Bitstamp, and Kucoin. This also includes less liquid exchanges like Lykke, Coinspot, and IDEX.

If your chosen exchange(s) is not covered, BearTax offers a workaround. This centres on a generic CSV template that allows you to add in your trades manually. Once you do, BearTax will then perform the required calculations. However, this option is extremely time-consuming, so it’s best to stick with one of the 50+ exchanges supported by BearTax.

Import from 50+ exchanges via API and CSV.
What Much Does BearTax Cost?

BearTax is a paid-for service, which consists of four different pricing plans. Before we provide a breakdown of what you get for your respective plan, it is important to note that you are not required to pay upfront.

Instead, once you have imported all of your transactions, you will get to choose a plan and make payment based on the extensiveness of your trades.

For example, if you only performed 15 trades throughout the financial year, then you would only need the basic plan – which costs just $1 per year.

BearTax Pricing Structure
Basic Plan – $1 Per Year

The basic plan – which costs a measly $1 per year, allows you to track and calculate up to 20 transactions – which you can do across an unlimited number of exchanges. In fact, all four of the plans offered by BearTax allow you to track an unlimited number of cryptocurrency exchanges, which is great.

Intermediate Plan – $30 Per Year

The intermediate plan increases your annual allowance to 200 transactions per year. Moreover, you’ll also have access to email support – which the basic plan doesn’t allow.

Expert Plan – $100 Per Year

At $100 per year, the expert plan permits up to 1,000 transactions per year. Moreover, support is offered via live chat in real-time, as opposed to having to wait for an email reply.

The expert plan also allows you to merge multiple accounts at the same exchange (for example if you have two accounts at BitMEX for the purpose of automated trading – which is perfectly fine).

Professional Plan – $200 Per Year

The most expensive package offered by BearTax is that of its $200 per year professional plan. You will have the capacity to track up to 10,000 transactions per year, and you’ll also get priority chat support on a 24/7 basis.

The professional plan also allows you to connect your files with your chosen accountant, as well as import custom files.

Which Countries Does BearTax Support?

At the time of writing, BearTax only supports tax returns being reported in the following jurisdictions:

Australia
Canada
India
United States

The team at BearTax is looking to add more countries in the near future – with Japan in the pipeline for 2020.

Important Features Offered by TaxBear

Here’s a breakdown of some of the main features offered by BearTax:

FIFO and LIFO Calculations

Regardless of the specific tax category, it is important that you keep your FIFO (First in First Out) and LIFO (Last in First Out) calculations consistent.

Failure to do so can lead to sanctions from your respective tax authority. As such, BearTax allows you to choose whether you want to opt for FIFO or LIFO, and then implement this on all future calculations.

Apply FIFO or LIFO to process your trades based on the previous year’s tax filing method.
Form 8949

If you’re based in the US and you’ve previously completed a tax return – then you’ll know the importance of Form 8949. For those unaware, this is the form used to report annual capital gains and losses. The good news is that BearTax allows you to download your Form 8949 with all of the required information.

This effectively removes hours of manual work that would have otherwise been required. Furthermore, BearTax then allows you to automatically forward the form onto your accountant.

Autogenerated tax documents.
Audits

Did you know that most tax authorities around the world have the legal remit to audit your accounts years after they have been submitted? The IRS, for example, quotes a post-submission audit period of three years, albeit, it can go even further if it feels it is justified.

BearTax allows you to provide a full breakdown of any information that your respective tax agency requires. For example, if a specific transaction is being queried, you can simply log in to your BearTax account and view it in seconds.

Export to Account Software

BearTax also allows you to export your cryptocurrency tax obligations to external software programs. This includes the likes of TurboTax and TaxAct.

This is likely to be highly beneficial if your tax return includes other areas of your financial life – such as income tax, property tax, or capital gains made in other asset classes like stocks.

Purchase and Sale Price

When the BearTax system undergoes the process of calculating your profits and losses, it looks at a number of key variables. This includes the amount that you paid for the coin at the time of the purchase, as well as the amount received when you sold it.

Moreover, the TaxBear calculation also looks at whether the transaction is a short-term trade (less than 12 months) or a long-term trade (12 months or more). This is something that can impact the amount you owe, so it’s notable that TaxBear has you covered.

Do I Need to Pay Taxes on Cryptocurrency Profits? If so, how Much?

First and foremost, it is important to note that you should always seek professional advice from a qualified tax specialist – especially when it comes to a complex battleground like cryptocurrencies. With that said, those of you based in the US will all-but certainly need to pay taxes on your cryptocurrency gains in the following circumstances:

You sell cryptocurrencies that were acquired through mining
You sell cryptocurrencies that purchased from a third-party
You use cryptocurrencies to initiate a transaction, of which the cryptocurrencies were acquired through mining
You use cryptocurrencies to initiate a transaction, of which the cryptocurrencies were purchased from a third-party

As you can see from the above guidelines provided by Investopedia – you might be required to pay taxes even when your cryptocurrencies were used to purchase goods and services. This makes it extremely difficult to know how much you owe.

Crucially, this isn’t something that BearTax can help with – not least because it focuses exclusively on cryptocurrency profits and losses made through trading.

In terms of the specific rates, this will depend on a number of variables. For example, if the transaction was based on a purchase and sale that both occurred within a 12-month period, you’ll need to revert to short-term capital gains taxes. On the contrary, if the cryptocurrency trade was held over a period of 12 months or more, it will fall within the long-term capital gains bracket.

BearTax Review: The Verdict?

In summary, BearTax allows you to remove the highly cumbersome task of calculating your cryptocurrency profits and losses. In doing so, you will then have the capacity to report your annual gains in a seamless process.

All you are required to do is link your cryptocurrency exchanges with BearTax via a simple API, or alternatively, upload your CSV file directly into the platform. Either way, you’ll get a full breakdown of how much you will need to pay, subsequently saving you hours of manual work.

Even if you were to sign up to the professional plan – which is only required if you find yourself opening and closing up to 10,000 trades annually, BearTax will only set you back $200 per year. This could be the difference between you getting your cryptocurrency tax returns submitted correctly – or instead, receiving a demanding letter from your local tax authority.

How Beginner Friendly is Cryptohopper?

While many trading bots are best reserved for more experienced traders, Cryptohopper includes a number of features aimed at newbies. These include the Hopper Academy which is available to all members and allows everyone to access a video library that explains just how Cryptohopper works and the best ways to use the service.

Cryptohopper has also developed an active community, and for new entrants to cryptocurrency trading this should prove to be immensely useful. There are active Discord and Telegram groups, in addition to a special forum for members that is available in English, French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese.

As a result, new users are able to converse with and learn from more experienced users from around the world, and continue to learn around the clock.

The platform has also been designed to be easy to use, and doesn’t require any professional programming experience or advanced technical knowledge or skills.

In addition, Cryptohopper also allows for comprehensive backtesting, and beginners can easily check if their configurations are working accurately by playing around with and testing their setup.

Users can see how much they would have earned in the past and adjust their bots to gain a greater understanding of just how everything works while still learning the ropes.

Cryptohopper Marketplace

Your Cryptohopper dashboard will give you access to their marketplace, this is a feature that a lot of trading platforms are including these days. The marketplace allows you obtain trading strategies for your bots – some of these are free and others are paid. This is great for beginners as it essentially allows you to “plug & play” your chosen strategy created by more experience traders and test it out on your account.

If you an expert in creating trading bots, this could also be a source of income for you by creating and selling your own templates on the marketplace.

Is Cryptohopper Safe?

The project is very active on social media and boasts a large number of users, and new members can also browse Reddit posts in order to interact with past users and gauge the general sentiment regarding the project.

However, there is limited information available about who’s behind the project, although the company has made its Dutch company information public and is registered as Cryptohopper BV, Johan van Hasseltweg 18A 1022 WV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

As with all trading bots, users aren’t required to transfer any money to an account controlled by the bot developers, as the bots usually work via an API that allows them to execute trades on linked exchanges. It is necessary to provide your API keys which are generated on your preferred exchanges, and these keys give the bot restricted access to your account for trading purposes.

Furthermore, the bots do not obtain withdrawal rights, and in the event of a hack or data breach, nefarious actors would not be able to directly access your funds. The team at Cryptohopper have also developed working relationships with some of the industry’s leading exchanges and users can also set up two factor authentication (2FA) in order to further secure their accounts.

Cryptohopper Summary

Cryptohopper is an automated trading bot that trades on your behalf using trading algorithms. Once you connect a hopper to a cryptocurrency exchange, you can select a number of strategies that the bot will implement in order to try and make a profit.

The online dashboard allows users to easily monitor their performance as well as the reports of signallers and to subscribe to the best signals.

Users can also keep a track of their stats and trading history, as well as the price movements of around 75 cryptocurrencies. Although the service is simple to set up and easy to use it also incorporates a comprehensive range of trading features including:

Trailing stop-loss
Trailing stop-buy
Dollar Cost Averaging
Shorting
Trailing stop-short
Config pools
Triggers
Backtesting
Walletscrubber
Auto synchronize
Reserve funds
Manual buy and sell
Conclusion

Cryptohopper has been engineered to provide the general cryptocurrency community with a viable solution that helps traders to generate profits on a more consistent basis. The mix of technical indicators and third party trading experts or signallers provides traders with increased options as do the template and backtesting features.

While Cryptohopper is essentially an algorithmic trading bot it is easy to configure and use and suits newer traders as well as more experienced practitioners. The team have put considerable effort into developing a platform that is beginner friendly and new users are also able to access an extensive education and community led resource sections.

The inclusion of the Cryptohopper Academy video series and multi-lingual Hopper forum are extremely beneficial to anyone still getting to grips with either trading cryptocurrencies or learning just how to use trading bots.

With its comprehensive list of features, general user-friendliness, and support for 75 different cryptocurrencies and nine leading exchanges, Cryptohopper has a lot going for it and does well to stand out it a market full of competing trading bots and cryptocurrency management platforms.

To remain safe, it’s best to set up 2FA on your account, and to make full use of the free trial run, as well as make a modest financial commitment to start off. It may also be a good idea to connect the bot with a live account that contains a moderate amount of funds as there is less to risk if the bot underperforms or the signals do not generate the expected results.

It’s also important to note that while trading bots do not have withdrawal access, if they become compromised malicious actors can take advantage of a bot’s API access to purchase extremely low value coins that are then “pumped and dumped”. This has happened in the past, and it’s a security concern that needs to be addressed by both trading bot developers and cryptocurrency exchanges.

Furthermore, users have reported that the free third party signals are of a low quality, especially in sideways or bearish markets as the notifications arrive too late, and expose the trading bot to sudden downturns. As a result, users should devote some time to researching signallers and look into subscribing to the more reliable paid signal services.

With that being said, with the market starting to pick up, newer traders may look at the Cryptohopper platform as a simple way to get acquainted with the markets and learn how to trade cryptocurrencies before we experience a new bull run.

The platform is well positioned to serve both new and more experienced traders and incorporates a number of features that all its members can look to benefit from. It is well designed, easy to use and has developed an excellent reputation over the years and as such we recommend you check them out.

Read: Our Full Cryptohopper Review

Visit Cryptohopper

Cryptohopper lets its clients use a cloud-based platform that can manage numerous crypto positions on 8 major crypto (officially supported) exchanges. The exchanges that officially support Cryptohopper are:

KuCoin
Binance
Coinbase Pro
Bittrex
Poloniex
Kraken
Huobi
Bitfinex

Cryptohopper supports 75 tokens according to its website, so clients won’t have any trouble finding a token pair to trade.

How Cryptohopper Works

Cryptohopper will allow its clients to use a range of semi-automated trading tools on supported exchanges. Once it is configured by a user, the Cryptohopper bot will trade automatically on exchanges with a client’s account.

The platform also features trading signals that can help you decide if you want to enter or exit a position. In addition to automated trading, Cryptohopper also has social trading functionality that will let traders work together to profit.

Cryptohopper Tools

Cryptohopper will allow you to set up buying and selling parameters on any of the crypto exchanges that support its platform. The triggers that you decide to use can be configured to work in any market conditions, but the platform doesn’t really offer a fully automated trading algo.

Cryptohopper Dashboard

Cryptohopper has the following order types/trading tools:

Trailing Stop Loss – When a position moves in your favor, it can be a good idea to use a stop loss order that adjusts itself to the market, so that some of the gains will be a sure thing. A trailing stop loss does this for you, and Cryptohopper has it as a standard feature on its platform
Searching for Targets – One of the reasons why traders use automated tools is because they simply can’t be at a trading terminal 24/7. Cryptohopper will be at every exchange, all the time, looking to open or close a position when the market moves to a level that you determine. This is extremely handy for traders who aren’t able to make trading a full-time job but have a good idea of the positions they want to take.
Reserved Funds –If you want to make sure there is always something saved-up in your account, Cryptohopper has a reserved funds tool that lets you set aside a given amount of tokens. This may or may not be a useful feature for your individual style of trading, but it is a nice tool to have available.
Scalp Trading – Scalp trading (or ‘scalping’) is a way to make money quickly off of small market movements. Cryptohopper has automated the scalping process, and the platform will scalp on your behalf along parameters you decide.
Positive Pair Trading –The trend is your friend, and Cryptohopper has created a positive pair trading tool to help find the best opportunities for making a winning trade. Cryptohopper’s positive pair tool will look for any tokens pairs that have been performing well over the last 24 hours, and enter those markets.
Triggers – The crypto markets can move quickly, and Cryptohopper’s triggers allow you to get in on the action. You can set up triggers to buy or sell short any of the tokens that Cryptohopper supports, and make a trade when the market moves in the direction you think it will take.
Short Selling – Selling a token short means that you will be able to profit from a fall in its value, and Cryptohopper has created the ability to sell a token short when a trigger point it hit. You can also set up a level where the position would be closed, and your profit locked-in.
Dollar Cost Averaging – When you buy a larger position in smaller increments, the amount that the overall position cost to buy changes. This is called dollar-cost averaging, and Cryptohopper has built a dollar-cost averaging tool into its trading platform. There are many ways to use dollar-cost averaging, and you can learn more about it on Cryptohopper’s website.
Signalers – Cryptohopper allows third-party traders to act is signalers as a part of its social trading network. You are able to see the kind of trading track record that a signaler has, and trade your tokens with them. Of course, past trading success is no guarantee of future returns, but it is a nice option if you want to use the insights of other traders to potentially profit!
Cryptohopper Pricing

Cryptohopper has a three-tiered pricing model that also allows you to demo the lowest tier for a week at no cost.

Cryptohopper Pricing

Explorer: Starter package ($19 Per Month) – The starter packagae will cost $19 USD per month. This plan will give you the ability to manage 80 positions chosen from up to 15 tokens, with technical analysis applied every 10 minutes. You will also be able to set-up 2 triggers with this plan.

Is Cryptohopper a Better Platform?

If you are looking for a platform that can manage your crypto trading, Cryptohopper could be a good choice. It does offer a range of automated trading tools, that once configured are more or less automatic. Building your own trading algos might sound difficult, but Cryptohopper’s platform is very intuitive.

One area where Cryptohopper shines is the sheer number of positions it allows its customers to keep open. Even the most basic plan will allow you to trade up to 80 positions, which is a large number for any single trader. The cost to try Cryptohopper on a medium-term basis is also reasonable, and it can be paid for on a month-to-month basis.

Cryptohopper is a very capable automated trading platform, and it is a great fit for anyone who wants to be connected to the crypto markets all the time. Whether or not it is superior to 3commas is a subjective question, and would be answerable only on a case-by-case basis. Let’s look through what 3commas does, and get a feel for what it offers its clients.

3Commas: The Rundown

3commas offers its clients a range of automatic trading options. Unlike Cryptohopper, 3commas does have fully automated trading bots that will operate without being configured by the client.

3commas also allows the use of simple trading tools to create custom bots, and also has simple automated trading tools for simpler trading strategies.

Visit 3Commas

3commas will operate with the following crypto exchanges (supported features given according to 3commas website and reproduced verbatim):

Bittrex (Smart Trade, Portfolios, AutoTrading Bot)
Poloniex (Smart Trade, Portfolios)
HitBTC (Smart Trade)
Coinbase Pro (GDAX) (Smart Trade)
OKEx (Smart Trade, AutoTrading Bot)
Bitmex.com (AutoTrading Bot)
Kraken (SmartTrade)
Bitfinex (Smart Trade)
Binance (Smart Trade, Portfolios, AutoTrading Bot)
KuCoin (Smart Trade)
Bitstamp (Smart Trade)
Houbi Global (Smart Trade, AutoTrading Bot)
Gate.io (SmartTrade)

As you can see, the functionality of 3commas is highly dependent on what exchanges you feel comfortable using. For a deeper look into what each of these tools allows you to do, keep on reading!

The Tools

3commas has a flexible structure that allows traders to use mostly automatic trading bots, create automated trading sequences, or just use automated buying and selling tools.

This may be one area where 3commas is a better fit for some traders, as it has algos that are basically automatic once some simple parameters are created.

3Commas Dashboard
Smart Trading – The smart trading feature allows you to set up trade parameters that will be automatically executed by 3commas cloud-based platform. These tools are similar to the ones that are offered by Cryptohopper and will allow you to stay on top of the market without being lashed to a trading terminal. Both long and short trading is supported by the platform, as long as it is allowed by the exchange.
Auto Trading Bot – The Auto Trading Bot that 3commas is basically automatic. All you have to do is choose a token pair, and enter some basic trading parameters. Once the bot is active, it will work on your behalf to make profits. You can fine-tune the bot you use by choosing a long, short or composite strategy for the token pairs you want to trade, and the bot will basically do the rest.

Like everything on 3 commas, there are some variables you can tweak, and try to ramp up your gains. The composite bot tool allows you to mix long and short positions over a variety of token pairs, to take advantage of more complex trading strategies.

There is also a list of the top bots from the last 24 hours, in case you want to try and jump on a willing trend. All of these tools create the potential for profit and are almost totally automated. Of course, once you set the bot loose, you will be responsible for any losses, so starting small is probably a good idea.

3commas Pricing

3commas has three plans that offer more to traders as they climb the pricing ladder. Unlike Cryptohopper, 3commas does offer a 3 day free trial if you signup for their pro plan.

3Commas Pricing
The Starter Package – For $22 USD per month, 3commas will give you access to the Smart Trading terminal with no trading limits and include errors and cancelations notifications. Due to the fact that most of the crypto exchanges only support the Smart Trading terminal, this plan would probably be a good place for most traders to start.
The Advanced Package – For $37 USD per month, 3commas gives you everything from the Starter Package and adds access to simple bots, as well as personal signals provided by Trading View.
The Pro Package – The Pro Package from 3commas will set you back $75 USD per month and adds both complex and Bitmex bots to the offering, as well as full portfolio management. There are also deals for customers who sign up for longer periods of time with 3commas.

Which Automated Trading Platform is Better?

It is fair to say that both Cryptohopper and 3commas are great in their own regard. There are many overlapping features between the two platforms, and if you are looking for simple automated trading tools (not a trading bot), either one should be able to fulfill your needs.

One advantage that Cryptohopper has over 3commas is that the platform can be used without cost for a week, which is great for people who have never used an automated trading platform, and aren’t sure if it will be a good fit. Where 3Commas offers a 3 day free trial if you signup for their top “Pro” plan.

3commas is nice for people that want to have access to a fully-automatic trading platform, which will trade along parameters that are created by the client. Both offer marketplaces where you can purchase pre-built bots or trading signals and both work with a variety of the most popular crypto exchanges.

Cryptohopper’s starter plan is $19 per month and 3Comma’s is $22. But Cryptohopper’s top plan is $99 per month and 3Comma’s is $75 so it might make sense to go with 3Commas if you need more positions and Cryptohopper’s if you are just starting out.

We recommend you at least try out both free trial periods to see which one suits your needs best.

A Word on Safety

One of the biggest concern that surrounds automated trading platforms is how well they keep client funds safe. While both Cryptohopper and 3commas use industry-standard safety protocols, whenever you generate an API key for your account, you are putting funds at risk of theft.

Every trader will have to decide for themselves whether or not the risk of loss via theft is worth using an automated trading platform, which will trade real assets on their behalf. The upside is access to the markets on a nonstop basis, and the risk is that some crafty hackers will figure out a way to take advantage of a platform’s unforeseen security shortfall.

These safety risks aren’t specific to 3commas and Cryptohopper, which have done a good job in designing platforms that have adequate safety precautions.

It may be a good idea to start using automatic-trading with a small amount of tokens, and see how it goes. If you like the platform you choose, and the returns are good, it is always possible to add funds and increase the position sizes.","https://blockonomi.com/3commas-vs-cryptohopper/"

In terms of the sportsbook, casino and live casino. Once again the layout is very clear and concise. There are suitable graphics beside each of the menu items to allow you to quickly see what sports are on offer. You can use the search bar also to quickly find what you are looking for.

Advantages of Gambling with Bitcoin

For the FortuneJack Casino, it has one of the best filtering systems that you will see. You can switch between all of the various types of slots titles, as well as the other games on offer.

Bitsgap at a Glance

Contents [Show]

Bitsgap is advertised as a new way to trade across multiple exchanges, by finding the best rates and effectively managing your portfolio. The platform allows you to bring all of these elements under one roof, providing access from a single account at the click of a button. It has carefully designed features that will enable you to:

Quickly compare rates from heaps of digital currency markets
Trade and instantly switch between different exchanges
Keep track of your investments
Basic and advanced order types
Take advantage of the price difference between exchanges using arbitrage
Test your strategies out via a demo account facility without risking any capital

Currently, Bitsgap is integrated with 30 exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, Bitfinex, and more. Traders have access to 10,000+ cryptocurrency trading pairs and several technical indicators available to formulate your strategies. The platform offers an optimised and intuitive interface for both beginners and seasoned traders.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this free trial to understand how the platform works before you opt-in for a paid version.

Basic Plan at $19 a Month

The basic account comes with all standard features and allows you to engage in unlimited exchanges. However, there is a trading limit of $25,000.

You also get access to your cross-exchange portfolio, and can set up trading signals and extended order types. The demo trading option is also available together with two active automated trading bots.

Advanced Plan at $44 a Month

This account gives you all perks of the basic plan, with a $100,000 monthly trading limit. There is also a boost in the number of active trading bots from 2 to 5. In addition, you can also benefit from the Bitsgap arbitrage services.

Pro Plan at $110 a Month

The Pro Plan is most suited for traders who are looking for unlimited limits across unlimited exchanges. You can also set up 15 active bots to trade in live market conditions. Pro Plan owners will also receive priority support.

Note: Bistgap does not charge any fees for any trades. All of its services are included in the monthly subscription fee. Any fees on transactions are imposed by the respective exchange you are trading on.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

Another major plus is the wealth of resources made available on the platform, and the Support Section contains a number of guides, and FAQs that help people get to grips with the most important issues.

Furthermore, the team maintain a blog that details a number of key concepts for newer traders, and also provide further assistance via their Telegram group, YouTube Channel, and other social media channels, and members can gain access to the 3Commas Discord from inside their accounts.

Most importantly, on top of being easy to navigate, and incorporating a range of trading tools, 3Commas is also free to try, and anyone can make use of the free trial to test out the platform and play around with its various features.

"Best YouTube Alternatives: The Future Decentralized Video Platforms","Video hosting or sharing platforms represent services that facilitate the upload, viewing, sharing, and streaming of video-based content on the…","Video hosting or sharing platforms represent services that facilitate the upload, viewing, sharing, and streaming of video-based content on the Internet.

At this point in time, Google’s YouTube represents the world’s largest video sharing platform, with over 1.9 billion monthly logged users, one billion hours-worth of video watched daily, and 500+ hours of content uploaded every minute of the day.

Despite these impressive numbers, YouTube isn’t without flaws. In fact, the video-sharing platform has many disadvantages and has been involved in numerous controversies that spawn from its very nature – centralization.

These issues include, but are not limited to strict video monetisation policies, unfair video promotion algorithms, lack of a personalized support service, vague terms & conditions, data collection controversies, and privacy concerns.

Because of these pressing challenges, numerous YouTube viewers and content creators are actively considering the idea of migrating to an alternative platform.

The rise of blockchain technology has led to the appearance of several innovative video sharing platforms that are definitely worth anyone’s consideration.

While these platforms are considerably less widespread when compared to YouTube, some provide decentralization, open-source development, transparent terms & conditions, improved search algorithms, privacy-focused approaches, alternative payment systems for content creators (cryptocurrencies), and more.

Others provide blockchain-based decentralized infrastructures that are needed to obtain these benefits through existing platform integration.

Best blockchain-based YouTube alternatives

Contents [Show]

Without further ado, here is an overview of the market’s best blockchain-based alternatives to YouTube, alongside several options that are bound to improve the current video streaming solutions.

LBRY

LBRY does not refer to itself as a video sharing service, but rather as a marketplace for all types of digital content, with a focus being placed on video.

The platform aims to create a protocol-based association between users and their digital content- could be movies, games, book, or pictures.

The company markets its service towards those who are privacy-conscious, freedom lovers, artists, content producers, computer geeks, and many more.

Read our interview with the LBRY Ceo here.

LBRY.tv
Features

To understand LBRY, it is important to consider it as both a protocol and a service. With this in mind, the protocol provides the technical infrastructure required to run the decentralized and blockchain-based peer-to-peer network where users are free to share, purchase and download content.

The service itself is quite straight-forward – it simply allows users to browse, host, share, upload, purchase, and download all types of digital content. Thus, services such as content discovery, content distribution, and transaction settlement are all integrated within the technical infrastructure of the service, thereby providing users with a seamless experience.

The platform relies on LBRY credits which can be used to purchase digital content. The tokens can then be exchanged to other cryptocurrencies on supporting exchanges.

Copyright protection is ensured through the public ledger, where each upload and purchase is recorded, thus making it easier for content rights owners to carry out infringement actions against those who unlawfully republish their content.

In the long run, LBRY has the potential of becoming a fully-fledged ecosystem meant to facilitate the purchase, storage, sale, and security of all types of digital content, including but not limited to videos, music, apps, e-books, articles, code, and more.

User Interface

LBRY aims to make its platform as easy to use and straightforward as possible. From a video sharing standpoint, LBRY.TV offers a UI that’s skilfully-designed, and similar to other platforms such as YouTube.

Both free and paid videos can be found – watching free does not require taking extra steps such as creating an account, whereas paid videos do require crypto-based payments and registration.

D.Tube

According to the platform’s website, D.Tube represents the world’s first crypto-based video platform that’s decentralized and built using the infrastructure provided by the STEEM blockchain, alongside the IPFS P2P network.

Features

First of all, D.Tube offers a state-of-the-art video streaming service, where users can find and upload all types of content.

It has an integrated cryptocurrency incentive, as watching, uploading, sharing, and commenting on videos via the immutable STEEM blockchain helps users earn coin.

DTube Homepage

Additionally, the platform was designed to be censorship-resistant – from a technical standpoint, the company has no actual means to censor videos or enforce specific content guidelines. Censorship powers are placed in users’ hands, who decide which videos to censor or promote via upvotes and downvotes.

Users can also reward content creators with cryptocurrency, thus leading to a fully-fledged incentive program that provides a win-win situation to both users and uploaders.

Unlike YouTube and other video sharing services, D.Tube was designed to be fair to all users. With this in mind, the platform does not rely on hidden algorithms that decide which videos make the front page, and which ones can be monetized.

In fact, all service-related data is publicly-available. Last but not least, the service is ad-free. Users can decide to advertise by themselves within the videos they upload.

User interface

From a user interface standpoint, the platform is quite similar when compared to YouTube, in the sense that the UX shares a very similar design language.

As such, browsing D.Tube is bound to be a seamless experience, whereas watching content is always a pleasure. Browsing and discovering new videos is quite easy, as the service offers several sections, including hot videos, trending videos, new videos, watch later, watch again, and leading videos/users.

Dlive

This company was founded by a group of video content creators and consumers who grew tired of having to deal with the challenges put forth by the industry.

These include unfair content promotion, rising platform fees, censorship, and high monetization bars. Thus, this led to the creation of Dlive, which aims to act as a live streaming service that’s based on value-sharing, and strives to empower both viewers and creators through an innovative incentive system.

We covered DLive before when the biggest YouTuber, Pewdiepie, mentioned them on his channel, exposing the service to millions of his followers.

Features

As such, Dlive represents a blockchain-based and decentralized live streaming platform that’s based on three revolutionary features: Lemon, LINO and LINO Stake.

With this in mind, Dlive is built on top of a blockchain network where Lemon acts as a token that can be transacted within the platform, for the purpose of donating and subscribing to content creators.

DLive Homepage

LINO is an actual cryptocurrency that’s tradable outside the live streaming service – the coin can be earnt by both creators and viewers through content and voting rewards. Lastly, LINO holders can stake their tokens in order to receive a stake in the company.

This stake can then be used to elect validators, receive rewards, and cast votes on the future updates of the platform.

The platform’s blockchain-based infrastructure is censorship-resistant and employs an algorithm that fairly promotes all streamers. Thus, it has gained a considerable amount of popularity over the last few months.

User interface

From a live streaming standpoint, Dlive grants users and content creators access to a series of standard features that are offered by most other competitors in the industry.

These include easy access to hundreds of on-going live streams, a user chat service, the ability to subscribe to streamers, notifications, replays, highlights, and much more. The UX design employs a cool dark theme, whereas browsing for live streams is a seamless and fun experience.

Dlive also provides users with a series of knowledge pages, where they can learn more about the technicalities of Dlive, alongside the blockchain-based features that viewers and streamers can take advantage of. A professional customer support team is readily available to answer all questions.

BitChute

The company behind BitChute has a simple goal – resisting against internet censorship. To achieve this, the video-sharing platform is decentralized and community-funded, while employing a set of rules that help avoid censorship.

Features

In terms of BitChute’s features, it works similarly to most video sharing platforms available on the web. To upload content, users must create an account, whereas streaming is easily done without registration.

Bitchute Homepage

Video uploads are placed in a series of categories, including anime, arts, auto, beauty, business, cuisine, DIY, education, entertainment, health, music, news, family, etc. The service also features content for increased visibility.

While still in its infancy, BitChute has attracted a good number of users and a series of interesting uploads that aren’t available anywhere else on the internet.

User interface

The platform’s user interface is basic and strives to ensure simplicity. Some may say that it’s a bit old-school and lacking in some regards, but the service skilfully does its main job. Watching and uploading is bound to be a seamless experience.

THETA

Theta was started after an in-depth analysis of the current challenges, controversies, and issues surrounding the video streaming industry of today.

Its founders quickly figured out that the standard content delivery networks are unreliable while leading to high operational costs that are mostly absorbed by publishers, rather than operators. Similarly, traditional video streaming services are centralized and inefficient, thus leading to censorship and unfair promotional algorithms.

The THETA platform aims to provide users with a decentralized next-gen video delivery service.

Theta.tv
Features

As a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform, THETA ensures high quality and smooth video streaming, as videos are hosted on servers throughout the world and instantly made available to viewers on demand.

The P2P business model means that platform operators do not directly invest into hosting infrastructure – rather, this responsibility is put in the hands of thousands of incentivised hosts, thus significantly reducing platform operation costs. This leads to a higher earning potential for content creators, thus ensuring better-quality streams.

However, it’s important to keep in mind that it isn’t only content creators who are incentivised on THETA. Rather, viewers earn THETA Fuel rewards for sharing their bandwidth and computer resources. The THETA token can then be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, or used to reward content creators.

THETA employs an open-source approach for both its network and protocol, thus facilitating a significant degree of transparency. Furthermore, content providers and video platforms are free to use the existing API to build specialized decentralized applications (Dapps) for their audience.

User interface

The user interface is being designed to provide a beautiful interface that ensures ease-of-use. Browsing through movies, TV shows, e-sports, music, live streams and other content forms will be a seamless experience.

Do keep in mind that at the time of writing, the THETA Token end-to-end video streaming platform is still under development – current plans suggest that the service will go live later this year.

Verasity

Verasity was designed with the purpose of building the infrastructure that publishers require to serve different types of attention-rewarded video content to billions of users worldwide.

According to the company, the video streaming and advertising industries are currently dealing with a number of challenges including low engagement for ads, low publisher revenue, low viewership, intrusive ads, the prevalence of ad blocking software and more.

Verasity Homepage
Features

The challenges that have been mentioned above can be dealt with via VERASITY, which provides in-video rewards, alongside a number of loyalty schemes that are based on four components.

To kick things off, the platform provides a HTML5 and full HD video player that’s supported on most devices. The second component is an integrated SDK reward module into the market’s most popular video streaming platforms, which provides users with VRA token rewards based on their actions without negatively influencing the workflow of publishers or the way viewers interact with online video.

Thirdly, the VeraWallet app works in-video, and allows content viewers to earn, spend, and stake the VRA token as they please. Lastly, blockchain technology will be used to carry out verification and analytics of video interactions, and ad effectiveness.

Thus, the company aims to create a VRA-based virtuous cycle that provides incentives to advertisers, content publishers and viewers. With this in mind, VERASITY does not represent a video streaming platform, but rather an add-on that can be integrated within existing platforms to fix some of the challenges they’re currently dealing with.

User interface

The platform’s user interface is easy to operate, yet a good understanding of how the platform works is required to facilitate efficient usage of the provided tools.

Currently, VERASITY can be integrated within numerous video streaming services, including but not limited to YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, VideoJS, Kaltura, FlowPlayer, JWPLAYER, BrightCove, iVideoSmart, and more.

LivePeer

LivePeer represents an open-source video infrastructure service that’s built directly on top of the Ethereum blockchain, serving the purpose of providing video engineers with reliable and cost-effective video encoding.

The platform leverages blockchain particularities such as decentralization, in order to create innovative video streaming business models that are highly-scalable and low-cost.

Features

To put things better into perspective, LivePeer is currently creating a ‘platform as a service’ designed for project developers who require on-demand and live video capabilities. While videos can be embedded into websites with ease, this platform is attempting to increase the reliability of video workflow, while leading to great scalability and reduced costs, through a blockchain-based peer-to-peer infrastructure.

Livepeer Homepage

The platform can be leveraged by developers, users, and broadcasters, thanks to the variety of features that are being built for each user group. Thus, developers can utilize the platform for the purpose of powering video functionality.

Viewers will soon be able to stream video using applications that are built via LivePeer, whereas broadcasters with large audiences will take advantage of the platform’s tools in order to decrease infrastructure overhead.

Incentives are also offered to encourage the usage of LivePeer. As such, those who run the platform’s software can earn tokens by contributing with bandwidth and processing power.

The LPT token works via Ethereum, and is the exclusive payment methods supported by LivePeer. The token can be exchanged into other coins or fiat-based currencies via supporting exchanges.

User interface

Since this isn’t a video streaming service like some of the other platform’s highlighted in this article, it’s important to keep in mind that a solid technical understanding is required to ensure efficient usage of LivePeer’s tools and services.

Visit

Bottom Line

Based on everything that has been highlighted so far, the present and future of video streaming services is bright.

Blockchain integration, decentralization and user incentive protocols will power better, faster, censorship-resistant, and more profitable video streaming services that are much better alternatives when compared to traditional platforms.","https://blockonomi.com/youtube-alternative/"
"CryptoTaxCalculator Review: Simplify Your Cryptocurrency Taxes","With the continued growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, millions of people around the world have started investing in the crypto…","With the continued growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, millions of people around the world have started investing in the crypto market to take advantage of the unique opportunities it provides to generate income in different ways.

CryptoTaxCalculator was created to help crypto investors in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and Australia, identify which taxes they are subject to when it comes to crypto investments easily and automatically.

You can ensure that you don’t incur the IRS’s, or your local tax agency’s wrath in the future.

As crypto investment grew, so did the oversight of governments around the world who started not only regulating access to cryptocurrency buying services but also decided to tax crypto holders as they would with other types of property.

One of such countries was the United States, with the internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifying cryptocurrencies as property, making those investors who sold, traded, or used crypto as a payment method at some point subject to capital gain taxes.

CryptoTaxCalculator: Making Crypto Investment Easier

Contents [Show]

The taxing process is one of the most complex bureaucratic procedures in any country, requiring millions of people each year to go through a painstaking process to calculate how much taxes they have to pay, with cryptocurrencies being one of the most unknown areas when it comes to calculating.

While multiple solutions have been created to facilitate the calculation of how much should be paid in taxes each year there are a lot of doubts and a low number of platforms that have integrated such features when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

What is CryptoTaxCalculator?

Created back in 2018 soon after the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom of 2017, CryptoTaxCalculator was created as a solution to traditional tax assistance software to deal with the calculation of complex crypto transactions efficiently.

Shane Brunette, a software engineer with a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence and a double degree in Psychology/Economics, shared his proof of concept on Reddit and used the feedback to create the prototype of what would become CryptoTaxCalculator.

Version 2 of the product was launched in 2020, supporting over 100 crypto exchanges without requiring its users to run complex calculations or procedures.

Generate your tax reports

Normally, crypto investors will have to invest days of bookkeeping and manual calculations when dealing with taxes. If a user has been investing in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, the process could take even longer and be significantly more difficult.

CryptoTaxCalculator will automate the process of tax calculation by directly connecting to the user’s exchange information, categorizing transaction history, and processing the information to generate tax reports depending on the assessment.

How Does CryptoTaxCalculator Work?

CryptoTaxCalculator works by connecting to a user’s exchange data by using an Application Programming Interface (API) or Comma Separated Values (CSV) files, a process that is simpler than it sounds from the acronyms, or to their public wallet address.

Once it connects to the data source(s), the tool will automatically import the information to process it and generate a tax report based on the specific obligations of the user, automating all of the processes.

With CryptoTaxCalculator, users can connect to more than 100 exchanges and platforms to automatically import their data.

Support for every exchange

It operates with the most popular platforms such as Binance, Binance.US, BitFinex, BlockFi, Coinbase, Bybit, Coinbase, Crypto.com, Kraken, Huobi, Ledger Wallets, Uniswap, Yoroi, and many more.

If the exchange or platform you are using is not in the list of compatible platforms, you can contact CryptoTaxCalculator’s support team to get assistance on how to import the data to get your tax reports as fast and easy as possible.

Something else you should keep in mind is that CryptoTaxCalculator also offers support for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are a developing niche in the crypto ecosystem not supported by similar tools.

How Much Does CryptoTaxCalculator Cost?

CryptoTaxCalculator works with an annual subscription model which you can use to generate reports for all previous tax years, instead of paying for a single annual report.

This means that if you need to amend a report due to forgetting to add a waller or similar incident, you won’t need to pay extra.

There are 4 tiers to choose from, with all of them including a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of if you are not satisfied with how the platform works.

Pricing Options

At this time. these tiers start at $49 a year and can go up to $299, with the difference being the number of transactions supported.

The “Rookie”, ”Hobbyist”, and “Investor” tiers offer the same features but different transaction limits of 100, 2500, and 1000 transactions respectively. The features included on these tiers are:

Unlimited Exchanges
Exchange API Sync
CSV File ImportFIFO, LIFO, & Specific ID
Capital Gains Tax Report
Income Tax Report

Users familiar with crypto investment will also be familiar with the (joyful or sinking) feeling of waking up in the morning to be greeted by a pleasant or unpleasant surprise when they check their portfolio and see large gains or losses.

As a result of the volatility of the market, trading bots have become increasingly popular among traders by allowing them to remain in control of their trading at all times, with the bot not sleeping even while the trader is. In addition, a correctly specified bot allows trades to be executed faster and more efficiently than the trader would be able to do manually.

The explosion of popularity in cryptocurrency has also resulted in a big increase in the number of crypto trading bots available, either for free from open-source platforms or licensed to users in exchange for flat fees.

However, it is difficult to ascertain which of them work as intended and which of them are an absolute waste of time. This post will consider the background to what exactly trading bots are and whether they work for Bitcoin & Crypto trading (and more importantly, for your Bitcoin trading).

Best Crypto Trading Bots

In this section we will take a look at some of the popular and publicly-available bots you can use. In most cases these bots will offer more than automated trading. Some of the platforms give clients advanced trading tools, as well as access to numerous crypto exchanges.

Exchange Valet

Unlike many of the other trading bots on this list, Exchange Valet is more of a trading toolset and crypto portfolio management platform. Most crypto exchanges don’t give traders a ton of tools to use. Exchange Valet is filling in the gaps with commonly used trading tools like simultaneous stop loss and take profit orders.

If you are used to using a trading platform like MT4 or MT5, the ability to set simultaneous stop loss and take profit orders is taken for granted. Many exchanges don’t support either order type, or allow traders to use both at the same time.

Exchange Valet lets you set both stop loss and take profit orders at the time time, which is extremely useful for active traders.

Let’s say you want to open a position in BTC, but your expectation is that it will rally for another 10%. If you are wrong about the direction of the BTC market, there is no need to stick around and watch your trading capital get eaten up by a nasty downward price movement.

Exchange Valet’s platform would allow you to open up your BTC trade with both a stop loss and take profit order at whatever price level you like. If you are correct, and BTC rallies by 10%, Exchange Valet will lock in that profit by selling the position. If you got it wrong, your stop loss will keep a volatile market from blowing up your trading account.

Handy Portfolio Management Tools Too!

Exchange Valet also allows you to keep an eye on all your positions, and rebalance them almost automatically. The platform will display all of your crypto holdings on a pie chart, and allow you to buy a specific percentage of your portfolio’s total value in a single crypto.

Let’s say you want to hold 40% of your total portfolio’s value in ETH. Exchange Valet will give you a simple input field that will let you buy whatever percentage of any crypto that you like. This is an easy way to make sure you maintain the balance of cryptos that you like, without doing a ton of work.

Exchange Valet also has solid communication tools. All of your orders can be delivered via Telegram (they call it Speedtrade), and other information will be emailed to you if you like. Portfolio info can also be delivered with Telegram, or by using the platform’s proprietary chatbot.

Exchange Valet Lacks Some Features

If you are looking for an automated trading platform, Exchange Valet isn’t going to be a good choice for you. While it does offer super useful trading features, it really isn’t a trading bot. It is also limited to Binance and Bittrex. This may or may not be an issue, but it is something to consider.

Exchange Valet is also costs cryptos to use. The platform offers new users a 14 day free trial, but after that it will cost you $29 USD per month, $75 USD for three months, or $250 USD if you buy a year’s worth of service.

If you are an active trader with a big portfolio these prices could make sense, although there are other platforms that give you more features for a similar price.

Two areas where Exchange Valet shines are security and connectivity. The platform meets ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and ISO 27018 standards for data security. It also offers a lot of information via Telegram, which is great if you want to keep an eye on your portfolio when you aren’t in front of a computer.

Worth Learning More About

If you prefer to trade your own account, Exchange Valet could be a great tool for you. While it does lack algo-based trading features, it does offer traders all the tools they would find on a conventional trading platform.

Exchange Valet takes your security seriously, which is great to see. The communication tools that Exchange Valet built are also useful. If you are looking for a platform that fills in the gaps that exchanges left open, Exchange Valet is worth a deeper look!

CryptoTrader

The CryptoTrader bot is a cloud based trading bot that provides users with fully automated trading solutions while not requiring them to install the bot on their own system. CryptoTrader features a strategies ‘marketplace’ that allows users to buy their favorite trading strategy, or alternatively to sell strategies developed by themselves.

Cryptotrader supports most of the major exchanges for both backtesting and live trading, with the backtesting tool allowing users to review how their strategies would work under different market conditions.

CryptoTrader offers five different subscription plans, with fees ranging from 0.006 BTC to 0.087 BTC per month (Bitcoin is the only payment method accepted). The separate packages include a number of differences, including the number of bots operating on the user’s behalf as well as the maximum equity limit.

Although though some knowledge of coding is beneficial when setting up strategies in the CryptoTrader bot, there are a number of free and paid strategies available for users that are not experienced / interested in coding.

The CryptoTrader bot also has a wide level of interoperability, with the service offering email and text notifications to alert users on important market events or changes in trends.

Haasbot

Created in 2014 by Haasonline, Haasbot trades Bitcoin and many other altcoins,

Although Haasbot is probably the most complete of the trading bots that are currently available, doing much of the labour with relatively minimal input required from the user, in order to provide this service it is pretty expensive, with costs ranging from between 0.04 BTC and 0.07 BTC for a three-month period.

At those prices, it is clear that anybody willing to take a chance on it should be knowledgeable about what they expect to get out of the platform and be committed to doing so.

Haasbot is an outgrowth of HaasOnline Software, which was started by Stephan de Haas in the 1990’s. The same company is also behind HaasOnline Trade Server (HTS), which is a automated system that is designed to trade cryptocurrencies.

The Haasbot platform operates on Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and allows traders to choose from more than 10 different ‘bots’. The more you decide to spend, the more bots you will have access to on the platform.

Given the prices involved in using the bots, it is a good idea to do some research on the returns they have generated in the past.

Zignaly

Zignaly is a trading terminal with cryptocurrency trading bots that lets you trade automatically with help from external crypto signal providers. For the moment the platform costs just $12 per month.

The platform is incredibly easy to use and can be utilized as a passive income machine. Zignaly lets you easily connect with a TradingView account, so you can use it with your favorite indicators. Alternatively, you can use the Zignaly trading terminal to create your full strategy at once.

Because Zignaly is still pre-launch, the number of exchanges that it operates with is limited. The development team says that once the full version is live, KuCoin, Coinbase Pro, Poloniex and  Bittrex will be added to the platform. The company also plans to offer its clients unlimited currency pairs without any additional cost.

One of the nicest things about Zignaly, besides the price, is the developers’ commitment to transparency. The full development teams’ info is available online, and anyone who wants to learn more about the founders can find their personal information on their social media profiles.

Cap.Club

Cap.Club is a simple way to gain access to advanced trading features. The platform was designed in Russia, and currently works on Binance and Bittrex. The platform offers traders automated buying and selling algos, as well as advanced order types.

One of the first things that you will probably notice about Cap.Club is the simplicity of both its website and interface. If you are just getting into automated trading, or have little coding knowledge, this simplicity could be a big plus for you.

The platform comes in two versions.

The free version will give you all of the trading strategies that the full platform features, but you will be limited in how many can run at once. The free account is also limited in communication. The full version will send you alerts via both Email and Telegram, but the free one is only going to contact you with Email.

If you want to use the platform for free, it is ready to go. For those that want to upgrade, it currently costs $30 USD per month, or can also be bought on a yearly basis for a discounted price of $300 USD.

Simple to Use, Lots of High-End Features

Don’t let the simplicity of Cap.Club’s interface fool you, it delivers some high-end trading tools. In addition to limit and trailing orders, Cap.Club offers it users three trading programs:

Smart Sell (long)
Smart Buy-Sell (long)
Smart Sell-Buy (short)

These algos seek to make money automatically for Cap.Club’s clients. There aren’t a ton of reviews out there for how effective the algos are, but they are all 100% free to use with the basic package.

The platform that Cap.Club put together offers a lot of value, and also is a nice compromise between an algo-driven trading platform, and a trading platform that gives you some of the normal trading tools that are lacking on most crypto exchanges.

Cap.Club also includes a visual strategy editor with both the free, and premium package. If you understand how trading strategies work, but can’t put them into code, a visual strategy editor could be a good fit for you.

Instead of having to write your own algo in code, you can use a visual strategy editor to lay it out with symbols. Once you have the strategy together, it is simple to run. You may find that your strategy ideas are profitable, and they could help you outperform the market.

Cap.Club Gives You a Lot

The fact that Cap.Club allows you to use its platform for free is great. While you will be limited in how many strategies and APIs you can run at once, it will help you to figure out if the platform makes sense for you.

For frequent traders having some sort way to use limit and trading orders is almost necessary. Buying and selling at market rates isn’t ideal. Trailing stops and take profit orders can help you to ride a winning position, which makes it possible for a single position to make the entire subscription worthwhile.

The big downside to Cap.Club is the fact that it only supports two exchanges.

If you don’t want to trade with Binance or Bittrex, then Cap.Club isn’t going to be of much use to you. That said, it is really easy to set up Cap.Club with Binance and Bittrex, which makes opening a new account at one or both of the exchanges worth thinking about.

Easy Set-Up and Support

Once you open up your Cap.Club account, all you have to do is go to the exchange of your choice, and generate an API. You will get a new API, and a secret code. Just go back to Cap.Club, and enter the info into the fields it provides you with. The process is super simple, and should only take you a few minutes.

Cap.Club also has a deep support section online. If you need help connecting your exchange account to their platform, or figuring out how to use any of the tools, you should be able to find any information you need. The support is included with both account types, which is a great feature.

Overall Cap.Club looks like a capable automated trading platform that also gives traders some useful tools, as long as you use one of its two supported exchanges.

Signal Groups

Signal is a platform that is made specifically for Binance. Signal does give traders on Binance some badly needed tools, and a high level of connectivity. If you want automated trading, or to use another exchange, this platform isn’t for you.

Much like Exchange Valet, Signal gives traders the tools they would find on a trading platform like MT4. In addition to simultaneous stop loss and take profit orders, it also allows traders to program laddered buying, as well as trailing stops.

Most of the features that Signal offers are extremely useful for traders. While a platform like Signal isn’t really going to be useful for a crypto investor who is looking to HODL for the long-term, the tools that Signal delivers will help traders who are used to fully-featured trading platforms.

Signal is Built for Binance

If you trade on Binance and are looking for advanced trading tools, Signal could be the right platform for the job. As mentioned above, being able to use stop loss and take-profit orders simultaneously is a must for traders.

In addition to adding simultaneous stop loss and take-profit orders, Signal gives you the ability to buy into a position over a period of time. This is called a laddered buy, and it cab be handy if you think there is a big move coming in a token’s price.

Instead of buying your entire position at one, you can automatically set Signal up to do the buying for you. This can also be good for larger traders who want to spread their orders out, and reduce the chance they will influence the market price of a token noticeably.

Signal also offers two interesting tools that some traders might find useful.

The platform allows users to sell existing coins, and also has a ‘targets’ tool. The sell existing coins tool allows Signal users to sell specific coins, and the targets tools lets traders set levels where positions can be sold. Both tools may be handy for advanced traders.

Great Connectivity

Signal offers a simple set of tools, but it can be accessed from almost any device. Many of the other platforms on this list have to be run on a computer, and won’t work on iOS or Android.

Connectivity is one area where Signal shines. You can use the platform from just about any device, including the two most popular mobile operating systems. If you are looking for a fully-featured trading platform for Binance that you can use almost anywhere, Signal is a good fit.

The platform will also notify you via SMS when your orders are executed, which can be handy if you need to stay on top of the market. It also gives you the ability to track your trading performance over time, which can be very handy if you are trading frequently.

Not Built for Everyone

Signal isn’t going to be a good fit for every crypto trader out there. While it does fill in some gaps on Binance, it only works with one exchange, and doesn’t offer any sort of algorithmic trading options. If you are looking for a bot, this isn’t the platform for you.

There isn’t much information on the costs involved with using Signal, and it could be free. There is also the promise of more features in the future, as the website states that “this is just the beginning.”

If Signal is free to use, and the team behind it is planning to add exchanges and features in the future, it is very promising for the platform. As it stands today Signal is a good looking product that has a clean interface, as well as a solid development team behind it.

The platform seems to be geared towards frequent traders, and could be a good fit if you are on Binance, and trade a lot. Even with the more basic trading tools that Signal offers regular traders will probably have a much raiser life.

Live Trader

If you are looking for a one stop trading bot platform, Live Trader could be the thing for you. Depending on which plan you decide to sign up for, Live Trader will give you access to 25, 250 or 1000 unique trading bots.

Live Trader also works with some of the largest crypto exchanges out there. You can use Live Trader with Polonix, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Binance, KuCoin and Kraken. The platform is 100% cloud-hosted, which makes it easy to run on just about any hardware there is.

Connecting Live Trader to your exchange, or exchanges of choice is simple, and Live Trader has lots of support tools online to help its clients get their account set up quickly.

The real advantage that Live Trader offers clients is the sheer number of trading bots, as well as a novel back-testing system. Unlike some platforms that need direct access to an exchange to do backtesting, Live Trader can run advanced backtesting simulations on paper.

Live Trader Offers a Lot

The first thing to notice about Live Trader is the number of exchanges that it will function with. Instead of being limited by your trading bot, Live Trader gives you numerous choices for an exchange. It also allows you to run multiple trading strategies at the same time, depending on which plan you decide to purchase.

While Live Trader is a pay-only service, it does offer a limited free trial so you can learn more about what you would be buying if you sign-up. The basic plan allows you to run one strategy, the mid-level plan gives you five simulations strategies, and the top-level plan that gives you 1000 bots to choose from will let you run 10 of them at once!

If you are wondering about pricing, the base plan costs $15 USD per month, the mid-level plan costs $39 USD per month, and the top-level plan will run you $79 USD per month. Given that Live Trader takes care of all the hosting, the rates it charges aren’t unreasonable.

Geared for Algos

Live Trader is definitely set up for traders that want to use algos. If you are looking for a platform that will give you some advanced order types, and a few basic algos, Live Trader might be overkill. On the other hand, if you are looking for a deep selection of automated trading algos, Live Trader could be a perfect fit.

There are a truly amazing number of automated trading algos on Live Trader. In addition to the algos that Live Trader has available, there is also an algo marketplace you can browse through.

If you would like to develop your own trading tools, Live Trader has a strategy builder that will allow you to construct your own strategies, and back test them on any exchange the platform supports. All of this adds up to a huge selection of algos for automated crypto trading on some of the most popular crypto exchanges out there.

Not a Freebie

Live Trader does deliver a lot of algorithmic trading, but it isn’t cheap. If you are on the fence about how algos might fit into your crypto trading, Live Trader could be a lot to take on at first. The entry-level plan Live Trader isn’t too expensive, and could be a good place to get started with automated crypto trading.

With all the features that Live Trader includes, it is reasonable to expect that the more advanced plans would cost substantially more.

Live Trader lets you trade on numerous exchanges with a multitude of algos at the same time, which isn’t the easiest thing to do on the back-end. All those cloud servers cost money, and doing the same thing on your own machine would get expensive.

Live Trader is a Great Platform for Algo-Driven Trading

There isn’t any getting around the amount of algos that Live Trader lets you access with either the mid or high level subscription. Having 250+ algos to choose from is an amazing tool set for any crypto trader to use.

If you are looking for a platform that delivers loads of algos, works with many of the most popular crypto exchanges, and lets you do extensive off-exchange backtesting, Live Trader is worth learning more about.

All of the plans also have a solid support system backing them up, which you can learn more about on the platform’s website. The homepage also offers a chat window, which is nice to see!

GunBot

GunBot is a well known cryptocurrency trading bot which uses individual strategies that are completely customisable to fit your trading style. It can operate on the following exchanges: Bittrex, Binance, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Cex.io, GDAX, Kraken and Cryptopia. You can run the bot on your own computer or use a VPS and can manually add different coin pairs, pick a strategy and set it to work.

GunBot a versatile trading platform, and it also offers a lot of value for the money. The platform has a few different plans, that range from 0.04 BTC for the Starter Edition to 0.3 BTC for the Ultimate Edition. At current prices, the starter edition would only cost $160 USD, and offers users the option to buy a lifetime license for an additional fee.

The features that GunBot includes in its Starter Edition are worthwhile for the price. Included in the Starter Edition is a copy of GunBot Lite, as well as three algos to choose from. The next two levels add loads of functionality, with the Pro Edition adding backtesting capabilities, and cryptosight as standard features.

GunBot can be used on any of the major platforms, including Linix or VPS. It is estimated that there are more than 6,000 traders that use GunBot on a daily basis, and it has gotten numerous positive

Gekko

Gekko is an open-source trading bot and backtesting platform that supports 18 different Bitcoin exchanges. Gekko is entirely free and can be found on the GitHub platform. Gekko is a relatively straightforward trading app to use that includes an interface and basic strategies from the outset, which allows you to be more comfortable with the use of the bot.

Gekko also has a number of plugins available that will allow you to be updated regardless of what level of connectivity you have. Although Gekko is not a high-frequency trading bot (making only a couple of trades per week, depending on configuration), nor a bot which allows you to exploit arbitrage opportunities, its list of  supported exchanges and basic strategies means that it is probably a good place to start for anybody interested in utilizing Bitcoin trading bots.

Visit Gekko

Zenbot

Similar to Gekko, Zenbot is also an open-source trading bot for Bitcoin traders. As an open-source project, Zenbot is available for users to download and modify the code as necessary.

However, there have been question marks in the community over the development of Zenbot, with no updates having been made to the platform for a significant number of months. This means that no additional exchanges have been added to the platform for almost one year, meaning that it may have access to less information than some of its competitors. However, on the positive side, Zenbot, unlike Gekko, does offer high-frequency trading as well as supporting multiple cryptocurrencies in addition to Bitcoin.

What are Trading Bots?

In essence, a trading bot is a software program that interacts directly with financial exchanges (often using API’s to obtain and interpret relevant information) and places buy or sell orders on your behalf depending on the interpretation of the market data.

The bots make these decisions by monitoring the market’s price movement and reacting according to a set of predefined and pre-programmed rules. Typically, a trading bot will analyze market actions, such as volume, orders, price, and time, although they can generally be programmed to suit your own tastes and preferences.

Trading bots have been popular for many years in various conventional financial markets. However, trading bots have not been traditionally available to the average investor as they cost a significant amount of money.

For example, a Bloomberg terminal can often cost in excess of $10k. However, due to the transparent nature of blockchain, cryptocurrency exchanges tend to grant their customers direct market access that provides users with the opportunity to analyze the exchange’s electronic order book, which was a type of access that was traditionally exclusively available to brokers and investment houses in conventional financial markets.

With many people trading Bitcoin passively and therefore unable to dedicate large amounts of time to analyze the market, the intention is that Bitcoin bots will allow users to establish more efficient trading without having to keep on top of the market at all times.

Types of Trading Bot Strategies

Although the cryptocurrency market is much less mature than other financial markets, the digital nature of the market has meant that despite the fact that it has had significantly less time to integrate algorithmic trading, the technology has not been slow in catching up on its rivals in terms of providing a trading bot service, allowing for investors to obtain access to a wide range of trading strategies, some of the most popular of which are considered below:

Arbitrage

In the early days of cryptocurrency trading one of the primary strategies that traders used to make profits was arbitrage – i.e. buying assets in one market and then selling them in another for a higher price, thus earning profit on the difference. As cryptocurrency exchanges were decentralized, there were often large differentials between prices offered on various exchanges, meaning that profits could be made through arbitrage.

Although the spread between exchanges are much smaller now, they do still appear from time to time and trading bots can assist users in making the most of these differentials. In addition, arbitrage can also be utilized in traders looking to involve futures contracts in their trading strategies by benefiting from any difference that exists between a futures contract and its underlying asset, by considering futures contracts that are traded on various different exchanges.

Market Making

Trading bots can also allow investors to use the market making strategy. This strategy provides for “continuous buy and sell prices on a variety of spot digital currencies and digital currency derivatives contracts” in an effort to “capture the spread between the buy and sell price”.

In order to carry out the market making strategies, in involves making both buy and sell limit orders near the existing market place. As prices fluctuate, the trading bot will automatically and continuously place limit orders in order to profit from the spread.

Although this may be profitable at certain periods, the intense competition around this strategy can result in it being unprofitable, especially in low liquidity environments.

Do Trading Bots Work?

Trading bots work by reacting to the market. It gathers the data it needs in order to execute a trade based on analysis of the trading platform. However, with cryptocurrency, the trading platform only tells half of the story, with many rises and falls being based on other sources (such as John McAfee’s Twitter or other online rumors!) that cannot be programmed into the bot for analysis.

In addition, as noted above, the spread between the exchanges has flattened somewhat, meaning that the opportunities for inter-exchange arbitrage are much lower than in previous years.

Many trading bots use what is known as an exponential moving average (EMA) as a starting point for analyzing the market. EMA’s track market prices over a set time period, and bots can be programmed to react to what that price does – such as moving beyond certain thresholds.

By programming the bots, traders can set their thresholds to correspond with their risk appetites. However, one of the downsides of EMA is that it is based on past history, which, as all traders will know, is not indicative of future performance, especially in the cryptocurrency industry where volatility is rife. Therefore the question of whether trading bots work is a multi-faceted one in which the problem answer is that they work, but not necessarily for everybody.

Trading bots offer a variety of advantages, including having constant interaction with the market, as well as the not-insubstantial factor of removing the emotion from trading. However, on the other hand, by using the wrong trading strategy or relying on the trading strategy of others, a trading bot could simply end up automating a set of poor market trading decisions.

Reasons to Consider Using a Bot

Cryptos are a great new asset class, but it is hard to create a return from them in the same way that cash or a stock creates value. Most people associate stocks with gains from price appreciation, but many of the best stocks pay out dividends. There isn’t really an analogue for this in the crypto market, unless crypto owners lease out their cryptos to derive an income from their holdings.

From an investment standpoint, passive income is extremely important. As the last year has shown us, we can’t assume that asset prices will show gains year-over-year. One argument for holding stocks through a bear market is that they will continue to pay dividends, which can then be reinvested in the company when the stock prices is depressed.

Cryptos are more like a commodity than a company from an investment standpoint, which leaves investors with something of a problem. There is absolutely no reason to hold on to a commodity in a bear market, as it doesn’t deliver any kind of return aside from price appreciation.

Trading Bots Give Crypto Investors Income Options

If you want to put your crypto portfolio to work for you, trading bots could make sense to use. There are many different kinds of bots out there, and some can take advantage of market movements to create gains automatically.

Instead of relying on dividends, trading bots allow you to leverage your crypto holdings to make an income via trades. This system of income generation may not be quite as secure as compounding dividends, but it is one of the only options available to crypto investors.

The ‘bot’ is important because unlike a human, it is awake and looking for income opportunities 24/7. Of course, there is no such thing as free money.

Any risk that can generate a return has the potential to lose money. It is a good idea to make sure that any automated investment platform you choose to trust with your cryptos can prove that it works with a verifiable transaction history.

Be Realistic About Returns

It is easy to get carried away with dreams of quick money made in the financial markets.

The years that led up to the massive crypto rally of 2017 were amazing, but now the reality of the crypto market is setting in. If you are looking to make the kind of returns that many saw in 2017 with a trading bot, you will probably be disappointed, or go broke.

The simple fact is that in order to create returns, you have to take on risk. The bigger the risk, the greater the possible return. On the other hand, when you take big risks, the possibility that you will face catastrophic losses is very real. There isn’t any algo that can ‘de-risk’ trading, no matter how advanced it is.

If you are looking to make 3-6% per year on your crypto holdings with a trading bot, you will probably find something that works for you. There are many low risk trading strategies that do produce returns, and an algo will make sure that you don’t lose your discipline lunging for the brass ring.

Keep in mind that a portfolio manager than can consistently produce annual returns around 10% will beat 99% of professional money managers. Expecting an algo to do more than that probably isn’t wise.

Conclusion

Trading bots can assist traders in ensuring that they are always interacting with the market, even when they are physically unable to do so. They can assist in removing some of the stress and emotions that are often found in any financial trading markets, not least the cryptocurrency market.

However, trading bots are not for everybody, nor does everybody need one. Casual investors are not the prime target of trading bots, and if your intention is to buy and hold Bitcoin then a trading bot is probably not the correct investment for you.

In addition, if you are not a competent programmer or familiar with the creation of financial strategies, trading bots may also not be for you. However, if you have the requisite knowledge and ability to overcome these obstacles then a trading bot can be a worthwhile tool in monitoring and making gains from the Bitcoin market.","https://blockonomi.com/bitcoin-trading-bots/"

Bybit’s Main Features

As a P2P crypto to crypto derivatives trading platform, Bybit allows traders from various countries to participate in trading using up to 100x leverage.

These include a customer support service that includes a live chat function, and a Grey release feature which ensures that platform maintenance is conducted “on the go” which results in minimum downtime, and maintains around the clock access to live trading.

ByBit currently specialises in leveraged trading and perpetual contracts, and allows traders to take up both long and short positions in a select number of cryptocurrencies.

Contracts have no set expiry date at which they will be automatically settled, and most importantly, it’s key to remember that as a derivatives trading platform, there are no physical transfers of Bitcoin taking place between buyers and sellers on ByBit.

Contracts are settled in each underlying asset, with prices/quantities quoted in a range of leading fiat currencies.

Bybit Account Types and Limits

Bybit users all gain access to the same range of features after opening accounts and can trade in perpetual crypto derivative contracts in Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, and Ripple in relation to USD.

All users conduct trades by entering into an agreement with the seller for the future price of a given asset in a P2P fashion.

Bybit supports the following leveraged trading pairs:

BTC/USD: 1:100
ETH/USD: 1:50
EOS/USD: 1:50
XRP/USD: 1:50

As a purely crypto to crypto exchange, Bybit is one of the easier platforms to get started with and you can create an account using only an email address.

There is an option to register with a mobile number and this requires you to fill in your country, and phone number, as well your password.

How to Open an Account on Bybit

You can get started by clicking on the “Register” tab at the top right of the page. From here you can select either Email or Mobile Registration and enter the necessary details.

When choosing to register with an email address, you will be sent a unique verification code number which will allow you to gain access to your new account.

Currently anyone signing up can earn a bonus of $5 for making a first deposit of ≥0.05BTC while a first deposit of 0.5BTC or more earns a $50 bonus.

From here you can navigate to your “Account & Security” settings in order to set up your account username in addition to two factor authentication (2FA).

When you have finished configuring your account settings you can begin to deposit one of the supported currencies by clicking on “Assets/My Assets”.

You already have full access to the platform and can begin to trade once you have deposited funds and converted them into the asset that you would like to trade.

Bybit Trading Arena

When we tested the trading arena out for ourselves, our initial impression was that the layout is extremely clean. The platform utilizes a dark background in a somewhat minimalistic look, with each segment of the trading screen organized clearly and neatly.

This includes the main chart area that displays green and pink candles, with the order book and recent trade segments listed just to the right. On the very right hand hand side you have the ability to set your trading parameters, which you can do across limit, market, and conditional orders.

Before your trade is executed, Bybit presents a full breakdown of your order. This is especially useful considering the complexities associated with derivative contracts.

In terms of chart analysis, Bybit allows you to fully customized your trading screen. Chart candle movements can be adjusted between 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes, all the way up to 1 month.

You can also make changes to the scale of the chart. For example, you can include metrics such as left and right axis, percentages, indicator labels, and log scales. You can also customize the layout of the chart, including the colours and your preferred time zone.

All-in-all, while the trading arena offers a user-friendly platform to trade derivatives, Bybit have ensured that it is suitable for both novice and highly experienced traders.

So now that we’ve covered the main trading screen, in the next part of our Bybit review we are going to look at deposits and withdrawals.

Supported Currencies

Bybit currently only accepts a limited number of digital currencies including BTC, ETH, EOS, XRP, and USDT. Each currency can be both deposited and withdrawn but Bybit does not support any fiat currencies at this time.

However, funds are able to be displayed in the following currencies:

GBP
EUR
USD
AUD
CAD
CNY
CHF
HKD
JPY
KRW
Deposits/Withdrawals

There are no minimum deposit requirements; however, Bybit does enforce the following minimum withdrawal amounts.

Coin	Minimum
Deposit	Minimum
Withdrawal	Miner Fee
BTC	No Minimum	0.002BTC	0.0005BTC
ETH	No Minimum	0.02ETH	0.01ETH
EOS	No Minimum	0.2EOS	0.1EOS
XRP	No Minimum	20XRP	0.25XRP

 

Bybit processes withdrawals manually three times a day at 0800, 1600, and 2400 (UTC), and the cut-off time for withdrawals is 30 minutes before the scheduled withdrawal processing time. All withdrawals are credited to your wallet 1 to 2 hours after a review.

ByBit Fees and Charges

Bybit does not charge any deposit or withdrawal fees, although a miner’s fee applies to all transfers. You can adjust fees when making a deposit, however, with withdrawals; the following fixed miners’ fees are applied regardless of the withdrawal amount.

     Coins	BTC	ETH	XRP	EOS	USDT
Mining Fees	0.0005	0.01	0.25	0.1	5

 

Every executed order on Bybit incurs a trading fee which is deducted from the account balance, although it does not affect the initial margin of the order. Furthermore, market makers who provide liquidity and increase the market depth of order book receive an incentive in the form of a negative trading fee, while market takers who do the opposite are charged a positive trading fee.

Trading Fee = Position Value x Trading Fee Rate

Perpetual Contracts	Highest Leverage	Maker Rebate	Taker Fee
BTC/USD	100x	-0.025%	0.075%
ETH/USD	50x	-0.025%	0.075%
XRP/USD	50x	-0.025%	0.075%
EOS/USD	50x	-0.025%	0.075%

 

If for example, Trader A buys 10,000 BTC/USD contracts via market order and Trader B sells 10,000 BTC/USD contracts using limit order, if the execution price is 8,000 USD, then the following is true:

Taker fee for Trader A = 10,000/8,000 x 0.075% = 0.0009375 BTC
Maker rebate for Trader B = 10,000/8,000 x -0.025% = -0.0003125 BTC

Therefore, upon execution, Trader A will pay 0.0009375 BTC of the Taker fee and Trader B will receive 0.0003125 BTC of the Maker rebate.

Funding Fee

A position funding fee is also applied on the platform which is exchanged between the long positions and the short positions. The funding fee works to ensure that exchange prices stay anchored to the global spot price, and funding is exchanged directly between buyers and sellers every 8 hours.

A positive funding rate sees long positions pay short positions and when it becomes negative, the short position holders pay the long position holders. You are not charged when you close your position before the funding interval.

The funding fee is calculated as follows: funding fee = position value*funding rate. Position value = quantity of contract/mark price. If, for example, at 8:00 UTC you hold a long position of 10,000 BTC/USD contracts, and the mark price is 4,000 USD. Supposing that the funding rate is 0.02%, the position value will be 10,000/4,000=2.5 BTC, and the the funding fee is 2.5 BTC *0.02%=0.0005BTC.

Bybit Order Types

Bybit incorporates a number of order types including standard market orders which allow you to process trades as soon as you hit the button at the going market rate. Limit orders allow you select the price at which you want your order to execute at and give you more flexibility. You can “Buy /Long” or “Sell/Short” using either order type on Bybit.

Conditional Orders

Conditional orders are fulfilled once a pre-specified event occurs, which can include reaching a particular price level, and when configuring a conditional order, Bybit provides the following additional order options.

Post-Only- You will only pay a maker fee here as even if your limit price takes liquidity from the books, it will still be processed as a maker order.
Close On Trigger – This option ensures that your stop loss reduces your position regardless of any other open orders.

GoodTillCancelled –Results in your order remaining open until it gets filled or you cancel it.
ImmediateOrCancel – This option allows your order to go through immediately, and if not, get cancelled automatically.
FillOrKill – Your order will be cancelled if it is not filled with one trade.

The conditional orders can all be set up from the Conditional Orders tab and selecting from the options at the bottom if the box.

Bybit Leverage

If you have a slightly higher appetite for risk, then you’ll be pleased to know that the Bybit platform supports leverage trading. The amount of leverage on offer will depend on the derivative contract you plan to trade.

For example, if trading BTC/USD or ETH/USD, then you’ll be permitted to trade at up to 100x. On the other hand, EOS/USD and XRP/USD is capped at 25x, albeit, this is still a considerable amount of leverage to be trading with. As such, make sure that you have a firm grasp of how leverage works before you use it, as the reality is – you could lose your entire balance.

Moreover, Bybit has also installed risk limit levels on each of its four derivative contracts. However, this shouldn’t really have an impact on you unless you are an institutional grade investor, as you can trade up to 100 BTC or 300 ETH at the 100x level before your limits are reduced.

In terms of financing costs, this is charged on two main fronts. Notably, this includes the interest rate and any respective premium/discount factors. Funding takes place every eight hours.

United Kingdom

How Suitable is Bybit for Beginners?

Right off the bat it’s important to note that Bybit isn’t suited to beginners. The practice of leveraged trading can result in higher losses than first expected, and the volatile nature of futures markets makes them a part of the crypto sector best left to more experienced traders to navigate.

Having said that, Bybit provides a number of resources that allow experienced traders to continue to brush up their skills and improve their trading knowledge. These include the Bybit testnet and demo trading feature, and a Support Center which includes an extensive FAQ section which covers common questions that users may have.

Quite importantly, ByBit also offers live chat functionality and dedicated emails for customer/IT support. The team also make sure to maintain a wide range of social media channels including a Telegram group and Facebook page which helps to keep them easily accessible.

Other handy features include comprehensive trading charts via integration with TradingView, the mobile app available for both IOS and Android devices, and the API tools which allow you connect trading bots or any other apps which require data from Bybit.

In addition, the lack of trading limits, high liquidity levels, and the incorporation of a wide range of order types suit more experienced practitioners and the platform has been designed to be able to service the requirements of high frequency traders.

More active traders may also be interested in the Bybit Referral Program which sees a $10 bonus payment being given to anyone who refers a friend to the platform who goes on to deposit at least 0.02 BTC.

Bybit’s Referral Program

As a final note, it is also worth mentioning that Bybit offers users the chance to earn referral bonuses. For every new member that you are able to refer, you will receive the Bitcoin equilievent of 10 USD.

The user that you refer does need to deposit at least 0.02 BTC. At the time of writing, the referral bonus is only available for those funding their account with BTC, meaning that ETH, XRP and EOS deposits will not allow you to claim the bonus.

How Secure is Bybit?

The exchange has managed to remain resilient with regards to any potential hacks, but this is to be expected given its relative youth. The team behind Bybit make use of a range of security protocols which include full SSL encryption on the website to protect all your personal information.

User accounts are also protected via two-factor authentication (2FA), which can take the form of email, SMS, or external app verification.

Bybit also maintains that 100% of clients’ funds are stored using a Deterministic Cold Wallet System, and only small amounts of funds are kept in hot wallets to allow for immediate withdrawals.

Using a multi-signature cold wallet system enhances the platform’s security and the team also process withdrawals manually three times a day in order to limit the possibility of hackers gaining access to funds.

The team have also developed their Grey release update system which sees platform maintenance conducted “on the go” which results in minimum downtime, and provides traders which continuous access to live trading, thus limiting the possibility of “lost” trades. In order to ensure smooth and efficient trading Bybit derives its index prices by taking data from three exchanges, namely Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, and Kraken (33.3% each) and also makes use of an insurance fund that keeps users’ funds protected even if a number of adverse situations were to occur.

Insurance Fund

The fund is designed to decrease the possibility of Auto-Deleveraging, and when a liquidated order is closed at a price worse than bankrupt price, Bybit uses the balance of the Insurance Fund to cover the gap. Here, Auto-Deleveraging is only triggered when the Insurance Fund is insufficient.

During liquidations the balance of the Insurance Fund increases and decreases depending on the price difference between the final Liquidation Price and the Bankruptcy Price of each liquidated position. As a result:

When liquidations can be executed in the market at a price better than the Bankruptcy Price, the remaining margin will be added to the Insurance Fund.
Conversely, when the final execution price is worse than the Bankruptcy Price, the contract loss will be covered by the Insurance Fund.

As an example, a trader having a long position on BTC/USD with the liquidation price at 7,000 USD and Bankruptcy price at 6,950 USD will have this position liquidated once the Mark Price hits 7,000 USD. If this position can be liquidated at any price higher than 6,950 USD, then the remaining margin in BTC will be donated to the Insurance Fund. Also, if the final execution price is lower than 6,950 USD, then the Insurance Fund will be used to cover the contract loss.

In the event that the Insurance Fund is insufficient to cover the gap between the final execution price and Bankruptcy Price, the entire liquidation gets taken over by an Auto-Deleveraging System. Bybit users can keep a track of the current balance of the Insurance Fund by checking the Daily Insurance Fund Balance.

Conclusion

Having been founded in March 2018, Bybit is still a relatively new operator in terms of cryptocurrency derivatives trading but has emerged as serious alternative to more established platforms such as BitMEX.

While it’s suitable for a wide range of traders and provides valuable resources such as the testnet which allows extensive demo trading to take place, Bybit shines with regards to catering for more experienced high volume/frequency traders.

The lack of KYC requirements in addition to no real trading or deposit/withdrawal limits being implemented on the platform suit anyone looking to trade in large amounts anonymously, and the consistently high liquidity levels also suit anyone looking to take advantage of sudden market swings by making swift deposits onto the platform.

Despite still developing as a platform, Bybit incorporates a solid range of technical, security, and trading features that will enable it to establish itself in the midst of a growing amount of competition as an increasing number of crypto exchanges throw their hats into the futures trading ring.

All in all, Bybit suits anyone engaged in crypto margin trading, and provides a viable alternative to the services already being offered by exchanges such as BitMEX, PrimeXBT, Huobi, and Deribit.

Once again, as margin trading isn’t really suited to less experienced traders or anyone near the beginning their trading journey, it’s probably a good idea to create a testnet account and spend a considerable amount of time conducting demo trades with testnet funds in order to determine if margin trading and/or Bybit is the solution that you are looking for.

How to Get Started on Deribit

The Deribit website displays login and register panel in the center of the page and you can begin by clicking “Create Account”.

1) Create an Account

You can sign up by entering your email address, username, password and county of residence.

After confirming your email address by clicking the link in the confirmation email, you will gain access to your account.

2) Make a Deposit

You can fund your account by clicking the “Deposit” button at the top right of the page. You can then generate a deposit address that will allow you to transfer Bitcoin onto your Deribit account. When you have processed the transfer, Deribit will only require one confirmation before allowing you to begin trading.

The withdrawal process is very much the same, and you can access the “Withdrawal” tab via “My Account”. Once on the withdrawal page, you’ll need to enter your BTC wallet address, and the desired withdrawal amount. There are a number of priority level options and the choices are linked to the fee you are willing to pay, and the higher the priority, the higher the withdrawal fee.

3) Select BTC Futures or Options Trading

You can navigate your account in order to select your preferred type of trade. The main options are laid out on the left side of the dashboard, while other key features are located centrally.

The futures contracts are quite standard and have monthly expirations; Deribit’s price index is derived from a number of leading exchanges including Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX, Gemini, and Kraken.

Deribit sells future contracts for $10 each, and by using the order panel on the left-hand side, it is possible to choose the order type from Limit, Market, Stop Market, and Stop Limit.

The Stop Limit option allows the user to limit risk by changing the Trigger and Stop price depending on the desired Buy and Sell option. After reviewing the prospective order, it can be confirmed by clicking on BUY or SELL, and a confirmed order will appear at the bottom of the page among all open orders and positions.

Options on the platform are European style and can’t be executed before expiration as opposed to US style options. The Options section can be accessed by clicking on BTC Options on the upper left-hand side of the screen.

From here, order forms can be accessed by clicking on any order that has been posted on the back of the order panel.

With both futures and perpetual contract liquidations, 0.30% of the fee goes to the insurance fund, while 0.15% of underlying or 0.0015BTC per contract goes to the insurance fund for options liquidations.

Deliveries

Deliveries incur half the fees of taker orders, therefore:

Futures: 0.025%
Perpetual Futures: 0.025%
Options: 0.02%  
Is Deribit Safe?


The team makes use of cold storage in order to secure their users’ funds with approximately 95% of all BTC being held in this way. This helps the platform to remain resilient to hacking attempts but can also lead to slower customer withdrawals.

In addition, in order to further secure user accounts, Deribit incorporates two factor authentications (2FA), although this function is not enabled by default and must be set up after you login.

Furthermore, IP pinning provides additional security by identifying a change of IP address during a session, and terminating it as a result. The platform also allows users to adjust their session timeouts, and the default timeout period for inactivity on an account of one week can be shifted to just one hour.

Despite this, it’s always best practice to only keep funds on an exchange when they are being used for trading. Lastly, Deribit has an insurance fund that is set up to cover the losses of bankrupt traders.

The majority of trader positions should be reduced or closed by the platform’s real time incremental liquidation system, however bankruptcies still occur.

The insurance fund allows the withdrawals of profits from unexpired futures to be available immediately after settlement. The fund is maintained by liquidation order fees and if it gets depleted, bankruptcies become socialized among the winning traders. A list of bankruptcies is maintained on the “Insurance” page.

Is Deribit Suitable for Beginners?

Newer entrants to the world of cryptocurrency trading may be used to logging into an exchange, and trading cryptos for either digital or fiat currencies. However, Deribit deals in the more complicated world of derivatives and as a result, may not be suitable for newcomers.

In addition, the ability to margin trade and enter into leveraged trades adds a further level of risk and this makes the world of futures and options trading best suited to more experienced traders.

Having said that, the team have developed their live testnet which allows users to practice trading 10 BTC in demo funds, and learn various strategies as well as get to know the slightly complicated interface and different analytical tools.

The team have also made a number of resources available aimed at helping traders to improve their skill sets and these include a Blog, a Docs page, an FAQ page in the members section, and a YouTube channel which contains a number of explanatory videos.

Therefore, while it may not be the best place to start live trading, it may still be a good place to learn how to engage in derivatives trading.

Deribit Pros & Cons

Pros 

Transparent team
Futures and options trading available
Competitive trading fees
No deposit or withdrawal fees
High leverage offered

Cons

Not regulated
All account activity in BTC
No fiat support
Not beginner friendly
Conclusion

Deribit specializes in the trading of Bitcoin derivatives and provides access to the world of futures and options trading. The platform incorporates a number of features that may help it to gain a competitive advantage over exchanges such as BitMEX and Digitex and these include low fees, up to 100x leverage, test trading, and an insurance fund. Despite this, Bitcoin derivative trading is still relatively new and only accounts for small volumes being traded.

In addition, a lack of clarity regarding EU regulations means that Deribit isn’t regulated even though it offers derivatives and the complicated nature of the service may be difficult to overcome for newer traders.

The platform doesn’t support fiat payments and accounts are held in Bitcoin, which leaves users exposed to the volatility of BTC at all times. The exchange also chooses to block the inhabitants of certain jurisdictions, and is currently unavailable to residents of the United States, Canada, or the Netherlands.

Despite this, Deribit provides a viable alternative to other Bitcoin futures trading exchanges and incorporates a comprehensive range of features that appeal to more experienced traders.

The platform gives experienced futures and options traders exactly what they want and the wide range of analytics, high leverage, and insurance fund should prove enticing.

Less experienced traders may be better off with a platform such as IQ Option which allows its customers to trade Contracts for Difference (CFDs) on cryptocurrencies and is a much more straightforward platform to use.

Anyone who lacks experience but is determined to get into Bitcoin futures trading would be best served by going through the written resources and videos before spending time using a test account.

Due to its range of features, Deribit is a solid option for Bitcoin derivative traders but not recommended for beginners.

"Coinbase Review: Ultimate Guide to The Top Crypto Exchange","With the interest and investment in cryptocurrencies having surged over the past few years, the requirement for safe and secure…","With the interest and investment in cryptocurrencies having surged over the past few years, the requirement for safe and secure exchanges to facilitate the purchase of crypto has become increasingly important.

One of the most popular exchanges that is currently available is Coinbase.

Launched in San Francisco in 2012, Coinbase operates in 32 countries and has served over 12 million customers to exchange over $40 billion in digital currencies.

By 2013, Coinbase was the highest funded Bitcoin startup as well as the largest exchange of cryptocurrency in the world. Unlike other exchanges that require users to trade on a market, Coinbase allows users to trade their cryptocurrency at a set price that is based on their market value, which allows users to purchase their cryptocurrencies faster than other exchanges.

Coinbase is one of the easiest exchanges to use to purchase Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies with fiat via Bank Transfer, Credit Card, Debit Card & Even PayPal.

Coinbase Fees

Contents [Show]

Coinbase charge fees ranging from roughly 1.49% to 3.99%, depending on your payment method, with credit card transactions resulting in fees at the higher end of the scale.

Coinbase fees are generally lower than other competitors who operate a similar business model, such as Coinmama or CEX.

Coinbase allows users to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin along with a whole range of other cryptocurrencies with more being added all the time.

In addition, Coinbase operates the Coinbase Pro exchange, which is intended to focus on more advanced traders.

Setting up a Coinbase Account

By following the below step by step guide, you will be able to buy cryptocurrency through Coinbase.

Signing up – To create an account on Coinbase, all you need is your name, email address and password.
Account Type – Upon request, you will be asked to confirm your email address. Once completed, you will be redirected to the startup page, where you will be first requested to confirm whether you want to create an individual or business account.
Verify your Phone Number – The next step is verifying your phone number. The reason for this is to create a form of 2-factor identification in order to ensure that your account remains secure. Other 2-factor identification methods are also available, as set out below.
Set up Payment Method – As stated above, Coinbase allows customers to choose from two payment methods – bank transfer and credit card. For bank transfers, Coinbase will often set up one or two small transactions to and from your account, in order to verify your account. For credit cards, a screenshot of the credit card is necessary. Bank transfers in the US can take up to 4 to 5 days to complete, or 1-3 days by SEPA transfers in the EU, while credit and debit card transactions are instant. Coinbase also allows for users to link their Paypal account to the platform, but this can be used for proceeds made from selling cryptocurrency only.
Buy Cryptocurrency – Once you have funds in your account you can buy currency. It’s important to make sure that you are on the right tab of your account to purchase the correct currency. Before confirming the transaction, Coinbase provides you with details of the service fee and the amount of cryptocurrency being purchased in the transaction. Once confirmed, the amount of cryptocurrency that you have purchased will be credited to the relevant Coinbase wallet.

Is Coinbase Safe?

One of the perceptions of cryptocurrency among newcomers to the platform is that it is still risky to invest in. And although it is correct that there have been issues around cryptocurrency exchanges in the past (such as Mt. Gox),

Coinbase is considered to be one of the most secure platforms currently available. First of all, Coinbase is US based and is therefore required to comply with US State and Federal law. This can be contrasted with some of their competitors that operate in countries that may have lighter regulations when it comes to such platforms.

Coinbase has actively pursued discussions with regulators in order to ensure that they were providing an open and innovative financial system and the regulation of Coinbase is considered by some to have restored confidence in cryptocurrencies following the Mt Gox collapsed (although other commentators have complained that Coinbase operates more like a bank, which, within the community, is against the fundamental nature of a decentralised cryptocurrency).

In addition, Coinbase has received investment from a number of high-profile backers, including the Bank of Tokyo and BBVA, which boosts its legitimacy

When it comes to storage of funds, Coinbase is transparent about its methods. Coinbase segregates customer funds from company operational funds, with Coinbase stating on their website that any funds held on behalf of customers are stored in custodial bank accounts and, in the event of insolvency, neither Coinbase nor its creditors would have any rights or entitlements to such customer funds.

In terms of its cryptocurrency storage, Coinbase states that 98% of customers’ cryptocurrency funds and stored offline, through hardware wallets and paper wallets that are stored in vaults and safety deposit boxes worldwide.

In addition, Coinbase states that the remaining portion of cryptocurrency that is stored online is insured, and that in the event of a hack, customers will be entitled to receive any funds lost through this insurance policy.

Coinbase offers customers a 2-factor authentication method, which can be through SMS to your phone, or through third party apps such as Google Authenticator or Duo.

In addition, Coinbase notifies users if a new device or IP address attempts to access your customer account. However, despite this, if customer accounts are compromised, Coinbase does not accept any liability for funds being lost. For that reason, it is typically recommended that once you have purchased any cryptocurrency on the Coinbase exchange, you store this cryptocurrency offline in a wallet that you control.

We have written a separate post which goes into more detail about the security of coinbase.

Coinbase Customer Support

Coinbase offers customer support through email, as well as having a Knowledge Base and FAQs page available for customers.

Wait times for customer support may vary, with the huge increase in demand for the service in recent months resulting in some delays.

However, typical response times tend to be within 24-72 hours. Some users have expressed frustration with receiving “canned responses” that don’t entirely address the issue raised.

Supported Countries

Coinbase serves customers in the following countries:

Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States.

Transaction Limits

Transaction limits vary from country to country, as well as variations as a result of payment methods and verification status. You can view your limits through a link on the account’s limits page. Coinbase also allows users to apply for higher limits, although these applications are not generally applicable to credit card transactions.

To apply for higher limits you will need to verify your identity and fully verified US residents can transaction up to $50,000 per week, while verified European customers may have a maximum of $30,000 in their account at any time. Users can check their limits through their account.

Transactions Using Cryptocurrency

It is easy to store, send and receive cryptocurrency through Coinbase:

To send or store crypto all you need to do is navigate to the Send tab of your account, choose the wallet you wish to send coins from, enter the amount and the public key of the recipient address and click send.
To receive cryptocurrency, you need to navigate to the Accounts tab, click on the wallet where you want funds to go and click Receive. Once you’ve clicked receive you will be provided with your account’s wallet address which can be used by the sender to transfer the cryptocurrency to you.
Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro ( formally GDAX )

In 2015, Coinbase rebranded the exchange element of the company as GDAX and then again in 2018 to “Coinbase Pro”, to separate the ‘trading’ element of the exchange from the more casual consumer platform.

You will find that you can avoid Coinbase fees by using GDAX as your buying / trading platform by sending a bank transfer to Coinbase and then using Coinbase Pro for purchasing.

All Coinbase customers automatically have an account on Coinbase Pro, you login with the same credentials as you would on the Coinbase website. You can find out more about the two exchanges in our Coinbase vs GDAX comparison post.

Coinbase Pro is designed to appeal to more advanced traders who want to know more than just the basics of market fluctuations related to cryptocurrency pairs.

There are real-time orderbooks, trade histories, and charting tools. At the same time, the interface on Coinbase Pro is highly intuitive, making it possible for traders to start using the platform right away.

If you want to find out more about their Coinbase Pro offering, read our complete review here.

Monitoring of Accounts

One of the criticisms from the online community about Coinbase is that has been known to track where its customers send their cryptocurrency, and may ban users from making certain transfers (for example for transactions with gambling sites or darknet purchases).

Coinbase is also involved in a running dispute with the IRS where they are fighting requests to hand over all customer’s financial data under a “John Doe” summons.

Coinbase Downtime

Back in 2017 when the Bitcoin price was been surging to new heights, seemingly on a daily basis. During these periods of extremely high usage, there has been some downtime for the site and the app which has been causing people to be unable to trade or purchase on the system. Unfortunately these are part of the growing pains of the service which is adding customers at an unprecedented rate.

Coinbase has assured it’s customers that they are working on the scaling problem – it is not a huge deal at the moment and has only seen a few hours downtime in total but we thought we’d mention it. This seems to be a common problem across a few exchanges which are all straining under the weight of soaring usage and new people looking to get involved in Cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase seems to have this problem under control now but we will have to wait and see when the next bull run happens whether that have added enough capacity to handle the loads.

Coinbase Custody

Coinbase also offer custody for cryptocurrency assets for institutions in the form of their custody program, which charges a setup fee of $100,000 and a minimum holding of $10million so you can see it is aimed at banks, hedge funds and other finance institutions who would require such a service.

While the program is still in its early phase, they already have their first client and have accepted their first deposit. Custody services are a way for large financial organizations to securely deposit their assets in a way that is insured. This service, the first of its kind, could lead to larger institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies at large.

Coinbase and Paradex

Recently, Coinbase announced the acquisition of Paradex which is a decentralized exchange for Ethereum ERC-20 tokens, they are hoping to integrate some of this into their offerings and make a wide range of tokens tradeable on their Coinbase Pro platform.

This is good news for their customers and indeed any holders of coins which will be listed as this should greatly increase the exposure of these assets to a wider range of people.

Instant UK Bank Purchases

Coinbase have recently rolled instant UK bank account purchases, that means you are now able to link any UK bank and enjoy near-instant purchases of their supported currencies.

It also means you can deposit and withdraw back to your bank making Coinbase one of the fastest and most efficient ways to convert your coins back to fiat.

Before this step, the process took a lot longer and involved international bank transfers and more fees involved in the conversion of cryptocurrencies. If you are based in the UK, this is a huge positive for using Coinbase as your fiat on-ramp and off-ramp.

Visit your account settings page and click “Link a New Account” to see the new UK Bank account option.

Coinbase Bundle

Another new addition to the Coinbase platform is their “Coinbase Bundle”. The bundle is an easy way to buy all 5 cryptocurrencies they currently offer ( BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, ETC).

Onside your account you will see the option to purchase the Coinbase bundle, you simply enter an amount you wish to purchase and it will automatically be split between the coins as follows:

75.2% Bitcoin
15.58% Ethereum
6.11% Bitcoin Cash
2.33% Litecoin
0.78% Ethereum Classic

This is an easy way to gain exposure to the coins currently available on Coinbase.

Coinbase Custody

Coinbase also operates a custody service aimed at financial institutions and segregates and holds digital assets in trust for the benefit of its clients. Coinbase Custody operates as a standalone; independently-capitalized business to Coinbase Inc. and is a fiduciary under New York State Banking Law.

In addition, it is fully insured, regulatory compliant, undergoes regular external financial and security audits, and is SOC 2 Type I certified with SOC 2 Type II, and SOC1 Type II certification expected in the near future.

Coinbase simplifies the process of purchasing and securely storing high quantities of cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, and there is currently an implementation fee of up to $10,000 and clients are expected to retain a minimum holding balance of $1,000,000.

Coinbase Staking

The custody service also allows asset holders to “stake” their tokens, and the team have unveiled Tezos (XTZ) staking for their clients, and the ability to participate in staking allows institutions to securely participate in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based projects that reward parties for helping to secure the blockchain network by staking their assets.

Client assets are held in segregated cold storage, and Coinbase Custody runs its own nodes and validators and operates first class, institutional grade security and infrastructure standards. In addition to staking, Coinbase Custody will soon introduce governance support for the Maker (MKR) protocol, with Maker and Tezos voting expected to be integrated in Q2, 2019.

Key Features:

Security – Coinbase Custody uses 100% offline, segregated storage for all client funds, and posts all bond requirements for its stakers.
Compliant – Coinbase Custody is a fiduciary and qualified custodian and offers staking services as a non-discretionary fiduciary activity to its clients.
Simplicity – Clients can enjoy simple deposit, withdrawal, reporting and consensus features across all assets on Coinbase Custody.
OTC Trading

Coinbase Custody is also integrated with Coinbase’s OTC desk and the vertically-integrated custody service provides clients with access to instant and anonymous liquidity. The Custody team completed its first OTC trade directly out of cold storage in March, and the OTC desk is agency-only, with all counterparties required to adhere to robust KYC and AML policies.

However, with Coinbase acting as an intermediary, the anonymity of the involved counterparties is preserved whilst guaranteeing settlement.

Custody clients can leverage the OTC desk to price and confirm trades before moving funds, and the OTC and Custody client service teams work together to simplify the entire process. Any clients initiating positions can buy OTC and settle assets directly into Custody.

Key Features:

Quick trading for offline funds
Agency-only OTC desk provides anonymous access to trusted counterparties
The OTC and Custody client service teams provide a seamless process from pricing risk through to trade settlement
The USDC Stablecoin

Coinbase also supports the USDC currency (USD Coin), an ERC-20 token and “stablecoin” with a price pegged to the price of the US Dollar. As a result, holders of the coin will always be able to redeem 1 USD Coin for US$1.00 and protect themselves from the volatility of holding digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

USDC is minted by Centre, a consortium that collectively holds US$1.00 for every single USDC with the funds being held in a consistently monitored and audited bank account. The stablecoins are issued by regulated and licensed financial institutions that maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency, and these issuers are required to report their USD reserve holdings on a regular basis with Grant Thornton LLP producing monthly reports on these holdings.

As a result, USDC is fully transparent and the project works within US money transmission laws, and the CENTRE open source technology project received early stage financial contributions from Circle and Coinbase, helping it to develop and it remains responsible for governing the currency and connecting its growing body of users and network of various stakeholders.

In addition to being supported by Coinbase and Coinbase Pro, USDC is also tradable on leading exchanges such as Binance, Bitfinex, Kucoin, OKEx, and Poloniex. As an ERC-20 token is also integrates with a variety of wallets, and can be used on decentralized platforms such as Bitpay, BlockFi, Dharma, Nexo, Melonport, and Loom.

How to earn free crypto with Coinbase

As part of its mission to create an open financial system, and make blockchain technology more accessible, the exchange operates the Coinbase Earn learning portal which allows users to earn cryptocurrencies, while learning about them at the same time.

Coinbase Earn aims to incentivize users to develop a deeper understanding of a digital asset, as well as its underlying technology, and does this by making easy to consume, educational content readily available.

Signup for Coinbase Earn

Verified users are able to earn crypto by completing a series of educational tasks such as watching videos, and filling out quizzes, and the initiative is open to eligible individuals located across the globe.

In addition to watching tutorials and answering quiz questions, users are also rewarded for sharing their unique referral links, and inviting other eligible friends to complete the lessons.

It’s currently possible to take courses on digital currencies such as Stellar Lumens (XLM), Zcash (ZEC), Basic Attention Token (BAT), and 0x (ZRX) with further currencies expected to be added in the future.

The Coinbase Wallet app

The Coinbase Wallet is a user controlled non-custodial digital currency wallet and decentralized app (dApp) browser.

Here, the private keys (that represent ownership of digital asset) are stored directly on your device and not held centrally on an exchange. This places users in control of their funds and there’s no need to have a Coinbase Consumer account in order to use the wallet.

The wallet is available to both iOS and Android users, and the app can be downloaded from the Apple and Google Play app stores.

Once downloaded, users can link their Coinbase.com accounts to the Coinbase Wallet app, and after completion, can easily transfer crypto to the wallet app at anytime with just a few clicks.

The wallet incorporates multi-coin support and allows users to manage popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and all ERC-20 tokens including the USDC stable currency.

In addition, the wallet also allows for the storage of digital collectibles and holds all ERC-721 collectibles and unique digital characters and creations.

The Coinbase Wallet also integrates with a range of dApps, and allows users to engage online games, and marketplaces, as well as in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects like Augur, and trade on decentralized exchanges and relayers like Kyber Network, Paradex, and Radar Relay.

The wallet is secured as users’ keys are protected with Secure Enclave and biometric authentication technology, and each users is in sole ownership of (and has sole knowledge of and access to) their private keys.

How to use the Coinbase Wallet App
Download either the iOS or Android app
Connect your Coinbase.com account by clicking “Connect Now” in the notification, or by selecting “Connect to Coinbase” from the Settings menu.

Once your account is linked, you can transfer funds from the Setting menu at any time, and you can also use the Settings menu to unlink your account whenever necessary.

You can find out more by reading our article covering the Coinbase Wallet integration.

The Coinbase Card

The recently announced Coinbase Card allows Coinbase customers based in the UK to easily spend cryptocurrencies both in-store and online.

The card can be used at any location integrated with the Visa network, and customers can use their card in millions of locations around the world, make payments via contactless, Chip and PIN technology, while also making cash withdrawals from supported ATMs.

The Visa debit card is linked to customers’ crypto account balances on Coinbase, giving them direct access to spending a variety of cryptocurrencies, and when using the card, Coinbase instantly converts the crypto to fiat currency, currently GBP,  which is then used to complete a purchase.

The Coinbase Card is the first debit card that directly links with a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the UK and EU, and the card facility is currently available in the UK, with support for other European countries planned in the coming months.

A complete list of fees and limits is included in the Cardholder Agreement, which can be found in the Coinbase Card App Setting.

The Coinbase Card app enables customers to access their accounts on the go, and select which of their crypto wallets they will use to fund their card spending.

The app also provides instant receipts, transaction summaries, and spending categories with both i0S and Android versions available and the app can be downloaded on the Apple and Google Play app stores.

In order to celebrate the launch of their crypto debit card, Coinbase are waiving the £4.95 card issuance fee for the first 1,000 people who sign up to join the waitlist.

Customers can download the iOS and Android app and link their Coinbase account, after linking any crypto balances held on Coinbase will be immediately available to spend via the virtual card with the Coinbase Card later being sent in the post.

Coinbase Security

Coinbase continues to take the protection of customer data seriously and employs a number of security protocols to safeguard sensitive information. For example, passwords and OAuth tokens are stored using AES-256 encryption on their servers, and all traffic goes over SSL to prevent third parties from monitoring connections.

Furthermore, all personal data is held by Coinbase and its partners securely and in accordance with all applicable laws, including the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation, further details can be found within Coinbase’s Privacy Policy.

In addition, the Coinbase Card is fully regulated and issued by Paysafe Financial Services Limited, who in turn is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011(FRN: 900015) for the issuing of electronic money and payment instruments.

Cards currently take anywhere from 5 to 7 business days to arrive, after being ordered, with card during the week in the afternoons. Cards ordered after this time will generally be sent out the following business day.

Further Expansion

The exchange has also recently announced further developments regarding its expansion plans with customers across Latin America and Asia being provided with greater access to the Coinbase service.

Approximately 11 new countries across both regions have been integrated into the Coinbase network and users in close to 53 countries across four continents are now able to purchase, store, trade, send, and receive cryptocurrencies on Coinbase.com and Coinbase Pro.

Customers in Asian hubs like Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and the Philippines; as well as the inhabitants of Latin American countries including Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru have all been welcomed to the fold, in addition to New Zealand of Oceania.

Conclusion

Although it’s not perfect, Coinbase offers customers (and especially newcomers to cryptocurrency) a practical and easy-to-use service for buying and selling cryptocurrency.

However, as with any online exchange, despite the security levels outlined above, the recommendation will always be that any cryptocurrency purchased through Coinbase should be transferred to personal wallets allowing you to have full access to the private key to your cryptocurrency.

Overall, it is a good introduction to the world of cryptocurrency and allows users to dip their toe into the world of cryptocurrency without it feeling like it’s a strange new world.

We have updated this review in 2020 to cover all the new options and features which Coinbase have been introducing.

They continue to go from strength to strength and remain the safest and easiest way for newcomers to get involved in cryptocurrency. They have rightly earned their position as a leader in the field.

"BitCasino Review: Licensed Bitcoin & Crypto Casino","BitCasino is an online gambling platform that was created with the focus being on those people who want to gamble…","BitCasino is an online gambling platform that was created with the focus being on those people who want to gamble using Bitcoin.

BitCasino has been in business since 2014 and it is under the ownership of mBet Solutions NV, a company that also has a Bitcoin sportsbook under its operation.

The BitCasino site is under the oversight and regulation of the authorities in Curacao. In its short lifespan, the site has undergone a number of different designs, constantly keeping things fresh for its players. It is well-stocked out with a varied library of games, catering for most popular needs.

This BitCasino review will look at all of the different aspects that make up this platform. You will be able to see the strengths and weaknesses that are part of this site, allowing you to make an informed decision.

BitCasino Game Offering

Contents [Show]

There is a comprehensive library of casino games to choose from on the BitCasino platform. Many leading game developers are looked after through this offering.

For slots players, there are more than 1,800 different options. You can quickly see what games are offered from different developers.

Some of the biggest names in the business are catered for, such as Play’n GO, Microgaming, Yggdrasil, Pragmatic, Evolution Gaming, Onetouch, Betsoft and Quickfire. There are different types of slots, from ultra-modern 3D games to video slots and more classic types of games.

Some of the most popular titles on the platform include the likes of Mr. Vegas, Gladiator and Aztec Treasures. If you do not want to put your hard-earned money on the line straight away, you are able to play all of these games for free.

Some of the 95 slots games on offer

At the time of writing, there were more than 30 different progressive slots to play. The jackpots for these titles varied widely, with some of the options such as Megah Moolah offering significant sums to be won.

The table games offering is a bit smaller than a lot of competitors, with fifty options in total. This is still satisfactory for the majority of online casino players, with all of the major bases being well-covered.

Blackjack is the most popular table game on the site, with numerous variants including High Roller and Perfect Pairs variants. Roulette is similarly very well-supported, with Baccarat also having a big emphasis, which you would not often see with a lot of online casinos. Then you have a selection of casino poker games and some niche options such as Dragon Tiger and Sic Bo.

BitCasino Live Casino Offering

There is also a comprehensive live casino offering on the BitCasino platform. Live dealer games have grown massively in popularity in recent years, with this type of offering only set to grow as the world moves into a 5G space.

In total, there are more than one hundred different live dealer games you have access to. The live dealer offering is powered by Evolution Gaming, one of the leaders in the live dealer space, with studios all across the world, catering for many different languages.

This is an HD experience across the board, with a very interactive environment from start to finish, with an ideal selection of betting limits for most types of games.

Live Casino Games

Once again, baccarat is one of the standout options, with more than 40 different variants on offer. Then you have a nice selection of roulette and blackjack games, as well as the likes of Monopoly Live and Casino Hold’em.

There is a section called Salon Prive that has six different games to try out. This is an exclusive offering that is available to high rollers and VIPs on the platform.

These titles will have a dedicated dealer, higher betting limits, ability to dictate the speed of the game, as well as having the option to have no other players in the lobby as you play, which would be a big bonus for certain types of players.

Welcome Bonus

At the moment, there does not appear to be a welcome bonus package on offer for new customers. Oftentimes, a platform will have welcome bonus packages as a way to entice people to sign up for an account.

These are often in the form of free spins, deposit bonuses or no deposit bonus funds. In the past, there have been welcome promotions running at the BitCasino.

The previous welcome bonus offer allowed you to have your first deposit matched 100%, up to a max bonus of 1 BTC. There were x35 wagering requirements for this offer, which is about average for the industry. There were also certain types of games that would contribute 100% to the wagering requirements, with some types of games not contributing at all.

Regular Promotions and Loyalty Program

There are regular promotions for existing customers of the BitCasino platform to avail of. These change on a regular basis, usually having interesting twists that are not seen with a lot of other operators. You can even see the past promotions that BitCasino has been running if you wish to do so on the site’s ‘Promotions’ page.

There is also a large prize pool that players can battle it out for by playing certain slots titles, with those at the head of the leaderboard getting some great prizes. There are also daily free spins and cash prizes when you play certain games.

The Loyalty Club

Naturally, most of these promotions and bonus funds bring along wagering requirements with them. BitCasino makes it very easy for you to track your progress towards hitting these targets. There is a bonus tracker on the top corner of the site when you have an active bonus so you can quickly see what needs to be done.

For BitCasino players, there is also a loyalty program that you can get involved in. The Loyalty Club allows you to rack up reward points when you play most types of games on the platform.

Overall, the promotions are decent, with a nice variety and the loyalty program is an ideal way of eking out extra perks from using the BitCasino platform.

Payment Methods

There are a few different types of payment methods that are now available to users on the BitCasino site.

Crypto deposits are easy to make

For the fiat deposit options, you can use a credit card, SticPay, Neteller, MuchBetter, debit card or EcoPayz. The process of adding funds using crypto is very easy and carries fewer transaction costs and is usually quicker than the fiat options.

For crypto withdrawals, they only take a matter of minutes, whereas some of the fiat options will take a few business days for your withdrawn funds to hit your respective account.

You can add crypto funds either by using a QR Code or by simply copying and pasting your wallet address when making the transaction. You will get a confirmation once this process has completed. You can also deposit using Bitcoin through a given debit card that supports this type of payment.

Security

As BitCasino is mainly a crypto casino, you know that the name of the fame will be anonymity and security. You do not have to add much information at all when you are signing up for an account on the BitCasino site.

Cobalt protects the payments on the site in addition to the other types of protection that is in place. This security supplier regularly checks for vulnerabilities and gives incentives for people to report any potential bugs.

Then you will be able to get started depositing via crypto without having to go through any of the standard verification checks that are associated with using fiat currency to add funds to an online gambling account.

For the protection of the site itself, there is SSL encryption used across the board on the site to ensure that all sensitive data is kept well protected. You can also use the likes of two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security onto your account. The casino software is very modern, with regular security checks being conducted to ensure that there are no flaws in the system.

To ensure the fairness of the games, there is also regular testing completed to ensure that there is no rigging of games.

There is also a TST badge displayed, which means that the games have undergone compliance checks by Gaming Laboratories International. This is a respected body for iGaming standards.

At the moment, there is no phone support option which may be a downside for some people, but this is a common trait with most crypto casinos.
Help center is packed full of information
Mobile Offering

If you are a fan of playing casino games on your mobile device, you are in luck. You can play the BitCasino games on your mobile device through all popular browsers.

This goes for all of the popular smartphone devices, such as Android and iPhones. There is a massive crossover of games from the BitCasino desktop site over to the mobile site, which is not something that is seen with a lot of competitors.

These games have been tailored for mobile play, so you will have a smooth experience across the board. The see of the BitCasino mobile platform is very good and the navigation is simple and easy to use. Currently, there is no dedicated BitCasino app for users, which may be a downside for some people.

Usually, the mobile casino gameplay experience is better when using a dedicated app rather than playing through a web browser. However, this may be something that BitCasino releases in the future as the offering continues to grow and grow.

Design & Usability

While the design of the BitCasino platform is very simple, the minimalistic style is very easy on the eye. The color scheme allows the text to properly stand out and the navigation system is one of the best around.

Bitsgap at a Glance

Contents [Show]

Bitsgap is advertised as a new way to trade across multiple exchanges, by finding the best rates and effectively managing your portfolio. The platform allows you to bring all of these elements under one roof, providing access from a single account at the click of a button. It has carefully designed features that will enable you to:

Quickly compare rates from heaps of digital currency markets
Trade and instantly switch between different exchanges
Keep track of your investments
Basic and advanced order types
Take advantage of the price difference between exchanges using arbitrage
Test your strategies out via a demo account facility without risking any capital

Currently, Bitsgap is integrated with 30 exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, Bitfinex, and more. Traders have access to 10,000+ cryptocurrency trading pairs and several technical indicators available to formulate your strategies. The platform offers an optimised and intuitive interface for both beginners and seasoned traders.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

What are Masternodes?

It’s helpful to understand what exactly a masternode does before we get into the nitty-gritty of setting one up. Essentially, a masternode is a full node, or a wallet that is always totally synced with its blockchain.

That last bit is important. The masternode needs to experience almost completely uninterrupted uptime to perform its duties on the blockchain.

Normal nodes support the blockchain and relay transactions. Masternodes, however, aid in keeping the blockchain private; perform instant transactions; play a vital role in governance, including voting; and make it possible for blockchains to maintain budgeting and treasury systems.

Read: What are Masternodes? Complete Guide

It’s worth fleshing those functions out a bit. Similar to a proof-of-stake system, masternodes hold a set amount of currency within the blockchain’s network. This alone supplies a substantial barrier to entry, as the amount of currency can be quite large.

This currency serves as a sort of anchor for the blockchain. A well-stocked masternode network has enough currency locked up to prevent any one wallet from establishing a monopoly on the blockchain and effectively centralizing it.

Masternodes’ increased capabilities regarding privacy and instant transactions are somewhat guaranteed by the amount of cold, hard cash it takes to operate one.

Basically, the amount of money spent just to qualify to be a masternode should, theoretically, incentivize the masternode operator to keep their operations honest and running at optimal capacity.

This collateral aspect of masternodes also comes into play in governance and voting. In theory, each masternode should be invested enough in the blockchain to ensure their decisions regarding its future are for the blockchain’s own good – or at least not malicious.

Becoming a Masternode

Sounds good – so, how does one set up a masternode and begin earning passive income, while simultaneously protecting and fostering the growth of any given blockchain?

The short answer is – it depends.

The long answer is that each blockchain has its own masternode requirements, although these can usually be broken up into two broad categories – staking and operations.

The first is relatively straightforward, and the amount that needs to be staked varies from blockchain to blockchain. Remember that staking is a way of keeping the masternode operator honest; you’re unlikely to make poor or outright damaging decisions regarding the blockchain if you stand to lose your own money.

On the Dash blockchain, the requirement for staking is 1,000 DASH. As of October 2018, this amounts to more than $162,000.

From just this one example, we can see that the barrier to entry is deliberately set high. Nor is Dash a crazy outlier, though it is on the upper end of the staking spectrum. PIVX requires masternodes to stake 10,000 PIVX, or about $12,000 worth.

If you’ve got enough capital to stake a masternode’s worth of any given cryptocurrency, the next step is making sure you have the operational requirements.

Masternode Hardware

Remember that a masternode has to be up and running 24/7, with no interruptions, in a fully synced state.

Because the hardware requirements for that kind of job can be demanding, there are many server companies who offer virtual private servers. A virtual private server, commonly referred to as a VPS, is a machine run remotely by a masternode user on a third-party’s hardware. The third party provides the capital investment in equipment, while the masternode operator provides the staking money and shares in the return on investment from the masternode itself.

There are legions of different VPS hosts, all with their own technical capabilities and fee structures. Since you’re liable to be staking tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of a given cryptocurrency, it pays to shop around and find the VPS that leaves you with the largest possible share of your masternode passive income.

Earning Money with Masternodes


Which leads us to the all-important question – how much money can one make operating a masternode?

Once again, the short answer is that it depends. Since each blockchain has different masternode requirements, the return on investment can be quite different. Additionally, there are individual costs to consider, including VPN fees or – if you’re operating your own hardware – the hardware’s initial cost and ongoing electrical costs.

Here are some brief guidelines for deciding which blockchain is best for you, as a potential masternode investor:

Do you believe in the coin’s technology and purpose? As a masternode operator, you’re going to have a direct say in the future of the coin. If you don’t believe it has long-term potential, you’d be better off investing in another blockchain.
Are the staking costs doable, given the expected return on investment? Some of the coins’ staking costs could produce sticker shock, but remember that masternodes are compensated for their “work.” Spending $100,000 versus $10,000 is a more complicated question than it seems. If the $100,000 investment produces a larger return on investment, it’s ultimately the smarter money plan than the $10,000 investment.
What are other folks saying? Masternodes exist as a community. What are extant masternodes saying? Are they happy with their returns? Is there competition to become a masternode, and how much do their votes matter given the coin’s governance scheme?
Is development of the coin active on GitHub or elsewhere? Even stunning returns on investment are a bad bet if the coin looks to be going nowhere.
Are the hardware requirements outlandish? Can you build a working rig yourself, or will you have to use a VPN? If so, is there a VPN with your technical requirements in your price range?
Mastering Masternodes

Operating a masternode can be a lucrative way to enter the cryptocurrency market. Perhaps more importantly, it can be a chance to support a given coin of your choosing in its development.

Although the upfront costs can be high, no one expects you to work for free. Check out each coin’s expected return on investment and balance it against your capabilities and upfront costs.

Remember that you’ll have a vital role in guiding the coin’s development, so make sure it’s a project you’re comfortable supporting for the long haul.

Overall, masternode operation does not need to be complex, though it is likely to be costly at first. Doing the proper amount of research at the very beginning can shave significant costs – and hassle – off your final investment.","https://blockonomi.com/vps-servers-masternode-hosting/"

History of XTB

XTB has a rich history that reaches back to 2002. In 2002, X-Trade was incorporated. With its location in Warsaw, it was, at the time, the very first foreign exchange brokerage house in Poland offering leverage. In 2004, X-Trade merged and became XTB as a way to comply with the updated regulations for the Polish market.

By 2005, XTB was authorized by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) for offering brokerage services across all types of financial products. In 2005, XTB earned the honor of “Best Broker in Europe” from the Money Markets Journal.

In 2006, XTB became part of the Polish National Clearing House and the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In 2007, it opened its first foreign branch, which was located in the Czech Republic. It followed this achievement by also opening offices in Romania, Slovakia, Germany, and Spain in 2008.

X-Trade Brokers rebranded to become XTB Online Trading in 2009. In 2010, XTB opened up new branches in Portugal, France, Italy, and Hungary. These branches included cross-border licensing in Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Bulgaria, Greece, and Belgium. The year 2010 also saw XTB establish subsidiaries in Turkey and the United Kingdom.

In 2016, XTB signed a deal with Mads Mikkelsen, the award-winning Hollywood actor, to become a brand ambassador. In 2016, XTB was successfully listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The first day that it was a publicly traded company, the shares rose over 4%.

XTB Account Types

XTB has multiple account types, including a demo account which is super easy to signup for and will allow you to test out the platform with either MetaTrader 4 or the web-based Xstation.

Demo Accounts – There is a Demo Account from XTB that lets you test out the platform without any commitment.
Standard Accounts – This account has access to over 1,500 instruments, including forex, commodities, crypto, indices, stock CFDs, and ETF CFDs. This account type has market execution, leverage of up to 1:200, a minimum spread of 0.35, and a minimum order of 0.1. There is negative balance protection and automated trading. Both account setup and management are free for this account type. You can use MT4 or xStation with this type of account.
Pro Accounts – have identical access to assets, with a minimum spread of 0.28 and maximum leverage of 1:200. There is free account set up without any management fees, and the minimum order size is 0.1 lot. This account type also works with both xStation and MT4.
Islamic Accounts –  are similar to Standard Accounts. The only differences are that they do not offer cryptocurrency trading and are swap-free.

Only the Standard and Pro Accounts are available to clients in the UK. Both of these types of accounts for UK clients use floating spreads, with Pro Accounts also featuring market execution. This involves paying a small commission in order to reach market levels. A UK Standard Account spreads float with a minimum of 0.9 pips, while Pro Accounts have a minimum spread of 0 pips, which are also floating.

XTB Account Signup


It is incredibly easy to create a trading account with XTB. To get started, simply fill out the online form, which you can easily find on the main page or nearly any other page on the XTB website.

While XTB verifies your details, you will get immediate access to the trading platforms. You will likely need to upload additional documents. After your application is approved, you can deposit your funds and begin trading.

Account Verification Requirements

After you create an account with XTB, you will need to activate it before you are able to start trading. This activation process is essentially XTB’s verification process, and it involves uploading required documents to prove your identity as well as your address. Specific requirements vary slightly by region but are generally very similar.

In the United Kingdom, for example, XTB accepts a passport, national identity card, or driver’s license as proof of identity. In the case of the latter two, you must upload an image of both the front and the back of the ID. The proof of address must be from the past three months and must be a full page.

It cannot be an online document. Accepted proof of address (in the UK) includes a bank statement, a utility bill, a phone bill for a landline, or a tax statement or bill. After XTB reviews and accepts your documents it will then officially activate your trading account.

XTB Spreads & Pips

With XTB, traders are able to enjoy spreads as high as 200:1 or as tight at 0.3 pips. To round it out, clients enjoy market level execution. For full transparency at all times, XTB includes the pip value, swaps, and spread on your deal ticket; this way, there are never any surprises. XTB also uses advanced trading technology that prevents requotes so you can trust that the trade will enjoy smooth execution.

Each instrument type has its own specific trading terms. If you visit the Market Analysis section of the XTB website, you can go to the Price Tables. Here, you will find the current price for each instrument, including figures for bid, ask, spread, and percent change.

Click on “Instrument Specification” below each chart to see the information for all instruments within a category, as this main page only displays around 10 to 15 of each instrument type due to space limitations.

XTB Deposits

To deposit funds into your XTB account and begin trading, simply log in and head to “Deposits.” From there, you just choose your trading account as well as the payment method. XTB offers many methods of depositing funds, some of which have additional charges and many of which are free.

Keep in mind that if you deposit funds into XTB in a currency that is not that of your bank funds, XTB will not pay for the exchange rates. There are also some variations in accepted deposit methods based on location.

Bank transfers are free and accepted in USD. In some cases, your bank may charge a transfer fee, although XTB will not charge you any additional fees. Bank transfers that you make to XTB must come from banks that are registered in your full name, with the name matching that of the XTB account. If this is not the case, you risk wasting time as the funds will return to the original bank account.

Deposits can also be made via credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, and Maestro. These deposits can be made in USD; XTB does not assess any additional fee for this transaction.

Finally, you can use one of several e-wallets to deposit funds into XTB. Paysafe, which used to be known as Skrill, comes with a fee equal to 2% of the amount deposited. SafetyPay comes with a 1.5% fee.

Deposit and withdrawal methods vary by region and country for XTB clients. In the UK, for example, you can also make a deposit via PayPal or Neteller, but SafetyPay is not an option. Deposits for UK accounts can be in USD, GBP, or EUR.

Minimum Deposit


The initial deposit into an XTB account must be at least £250, $250, or €250. After this initial deposit, there is no minimum size for subsequent deposits.

XTB Withdrawals

Withdrawing funds from your XTB account is just as straightforward as making a deposit. Visit your Client Office after logging in and choose the account you want to withdraw from. Next, choose the amount you want to withdraw.

Keep in mind that if your account that you want to withdraw the funds from is not in the same currency as your trading account, Pekao will convert the amount at its rate, either at the time the bank receives the payment or at the time of request. As is the case with deposits, you can only make a withdrawal to a bank account bearing your exact, matching name.

When making withdrawals, XTB processes the payments with the SHA model, covering the full cost that the Sending Bank charges. Your bank may charge you an additional fee. If you choose to withdraw less than $100, this will come with an extra $30 commission.

WITHDRAWAL FEE ON AMOUNTS SMALLER THAN THRESHOLD	THRESHOLD	AMOUNTS LARGER THAN THRESHOLD
20 USD	100 USD	Free
16 EUR	80 EUR	Free
12 GBP	60 GBP	Free

XTB Fees

Commissions vary slightly by account type. There is no commission on Standard Accounts for crypto, forex, indices, or commodities, with commissions on other types starting at 0.8% per lot. These are also the commissions (when applicable) for Islamic Accounts.

For Pro Accounts, the commissions on forex, indices, commodities, and cryptocurrencies start at $4 per lot. Commissions for stock CFDs and ETF CFDs start at 0.08% per lot.

XTB Service Levels

In addition to account types, XTB offers different service levels. These levels let the broker accommodate the needs of each client, regardless of their experience level or expertise.

Base service levels do not have a minimum volume in lots or a minimum deposit. This service level also provides clients with access to the Premium Educational Materials. The education system was created by XTB specialists and it includes materials for all skill levels to guide you through your trading journey.

Plus service levels have a minimum volume of 10 lots and a minimum deposit of 100 EUR. In addition to providing access to Premium Educational Materials, this service level provides access to Premium Research Materials, Premium Email and Push Notifications, and a priority pass to events, such as Trading Clubs.

The Premium Research Materials come from the XTB award-winning analyst team. They are designed to help you stay up-to-date with the latest market movements and provide expert guidance to support your strategies.

The Premium Email and Push Notifications include information like market news, trading signals, and analysis. The idea is to give you quick information that is actionable so you do not miss out on opportunities. The Trading Clubs occur weekly, and professional traders run these sessions to include real-time market analysis. There is also priority access to XTB Masterclasses.

Finally, the VIP service level requires a minimum trade volume of 100 lots and a minimum deposit of 25,000 EUR. In addition to all of the above, this service level gets one-to-one coaching sessions, market analysis on demand, and direct access to market analysis.

Market analysis on demand involves consultations with market analysts who can give you feedback on your trading strategy and explore specific markets for you. This goes hand-in-hand with direct access to market analysts so you can get information on market movements in real-time.

The one-to-one coaching sessions help you improve your technical analysis skills and tools, such as Market Geometry, Ichimoku, and Price Action. These sessions can also help develop trading psychology or risk management. VIPs can contact their Account Manager for a current list of available trainings.

XTB Trading Platforms

The Online Personal Wealth Awards named the XTB platform the “Best Trading Platform 2016.” The platform provides clients with live market commentary as well as an economic calendar. There is an ultra-fast execution speed and access to advanced chart trading tools. You can use XTB on any device, including your desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

There are two platform choices with XTB: xStation 5 and MetaTrader4.

xStation

xStation 5 is the award-winning platform from XTB. It’s simple to use and has superior execution speeds. This platform includes a trading calculator, advanced chart trading, trader statistics, advanced technical analysis, bulk order closing, Trader’s Talk, market sentiment, top movers, and equity screener.

xStation 5 is available for desktop devices, tablets, mobiles, and even smartwatches. The desktop version is fully functional and is the fastest version of the platform. The tablet application maximizes the tablet device version’s interface and delivers full trade management along with powerful tools.

Like the desktop version, it offers bulk order closing, complete trade management, and interactive charts that include technical indicators.

The mobile version is incredibly popular, with over 50% of XTB clients actively using it. It is filled with powerful tools and features, including complete trade management, the interactive charts, the technical indicators, and bulk order closing. The smartwatch application lets you trade the markets in just a few taps and it works with both Android and iOS smartwatches. The interface is simple to use, and you can trade and manage your orders right from your smartwatch.

MetaTrader 4

MetaTrader 4 is the most popular trading platform in the industry, providing XTB clients with all the benefits of a well-loved and easy-to-use platform. There is a vast array of analytical tools built right in as well as the ability to add automatic strategies, indicators, and oscillators.

One special feature of MT4 is the ability to optimize technical trading via powerful pattern recognition. This tool lets you spot trends that are just emerging so you can define the exit and entry points as well as set the profit taking and stop loss levels.

With a one-click dealing system, entering and exiting trades is quick and efficient. MT4 also has a strategy tester and a great deal of experience.

MetaTrader 4 is available for desktop, tablets, and mobile devices. The desktop version is full of features. The tablet version lets you have full control and management over your open transactions. The mobile version is available for both iOS and Android and lets you trade anywhere at any time. It includes intuitive abilities to execute transactions and analyze market trends.

Order Types

Those who trade on MetaTrader 4 with their XTB accounts can choosing from Buy Stop, Sell Stop, Sell Limit, and Buy Limit pending orders. There is also the ability to open a trade with an instant order. xStation also lets you make Stop Loss and Take Profit orders to make the most from your trades.

How Do You Trade with XTB?

The specific steps to trading with XTB will depend on the platform you use. With MetaTrader 4, you can open a trade by using the Market Watch window found along the platform’s left-hand side. Alternately, you can press the F9 button on your keyboard or go to the “tools” tab by the platform’s top menu. After this initial step, just fill in the relevant information for your trade and submit the information.

There are also three methods of placing a trade using xStation, all of which are simple and intuitive. You can do so via the Market Watch window, which opens when you click on the name of a market.

This window features a built-in calculator so you can view things such as commission, pip value, spread in pips and its monetary value, and daily swap points. You can also trade via the chart; specifically, look for the top left-hand corner where you will see buy and sell buttons plus the ability to modify the quantity.

Finally, you can opt to use the three-click trade functionality. When on the market you want to trade, select the “Place pending order on Chart” icon. Now, you can click where you want to trade on the chart, followed by where you would like to put the stop loss and then your profit target. This will give you a new deal ticket and you just have to select Buy or Sell.

XTB Trading Tools

One unique feature of XTB is that it provides clients with detailed live trader performance statistics. These statistics can be incredibly useful in terms of seeing areas for improvement and areas in which you are doing well.

The broker also offers a Trader’s Calculator that is designed to help you calculate your trade based on your reward and risk. This feature is built into xStation 5 and determines your potential loss or profit based on stop loss, limit order, and lot size. The calculator is designed to assist with risk management.

xStation 5 also includes advanced chart trading, letting you trade right from the charts and take advantage of pending orders, take profits, stop losses, and market orders. xStation 5 also includes advanced technical analysis via technical indicators such as RS, Moving Averages, Fibonacci Retracement, and others.

The bulk order closing trading tool lets you use a single click to close all losing or winning trades, limiting losses or locking in profits. The equity screener on xStation 5 lets you filter out stocks via an advanced screener to make it easier to find the best trading opportunities.

Those who trade with MetaTrader 4 get access to the Strategy Tester. This lets you test and optimize your EAs. Thanks to this trading tool, you can back test every strategy across your intervals and market assets to discover which solution works best. The results from Strategy Tester are extensive and divided into three tabs for thoroughness.

If you use MetaTrader 4, you will also have access to the MQL programming language, which lets you program and edit technical analysis tools. If you prefer not to create your own code for technical analysis tools, MT4 also includes access to the MQL4 community, which lets you share and/or download the tools, signals, and scripts or simply share strategies.

It is also possible to add technical analysis tools to MT4 without any use of MQL by downloading and saving a tool in the appropriate spot. You can find detailed information on this process in the XTB FAQ section.

MT4 also includes multiple other tools to assist you with trading, including the ability to create price alerts. MetaTrader also provides access to technical tools like Gann-based tools and Fibonacci indicators, as well as your choice of charts, including candlestick, bar, and line. It also has various oscillators and indicators like Stochastic Oscillator, RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages.

XTB also features an economic calendar on its website, as well as within the xStation platform, which the company refers to as a market calendar. As expected, this calendar includes a full listing of all the upcoming and current events that can influence the various markets. You can filter the search results by impact and country, or just view the whole thing.

You can also adjust the calendar view between a day, week, month, or a custom length of time. For each event, you will see the date and time, country, economic indicator, impact, period, current, forecast, and previous period.

Market News & Analysis

You can get market news and analysis directly via the xStation 5 platform with Trader’s Talk. This is a live audio feed right in the platform that lets you hear breaking news for real-time market opportunities.

On the XTB website, you will find an entire section dedicated to Market News. Visiting this page will show you the latest relevant information for markets that can be traded on XTB. You can view the headlines or read the specifics. Each article has a quick summary as well as more in-depth explanation, including charts and graphs where useful.

You will find news as well as analysis on this page. Most of the articles are available to anyone, but some are locked and require a login. Any type of XTB account gets full access to the news and analysis section.

XTB Education

To ensure that all clients have the knowledge they need available at their disposal, XTB offers an extensive Education section; this is one of the main navigation tabs on the website. Within the Education section, you can divide the Trading Academy sections up by skill level or topic. The skill levels include Basic, Intermediate, Expert, and Premium.

Basic helps you learn the most important information about the forex market, instruments, and trading platforms and teaches basic trading techniques. Intermediate takes it deeper by teaching fundamental and technical analysis. This is also where clients learn about managing risk and controlling emotions. Expert courses will be available very soon and will focus on advanced tools and techniques, expert trading knowledge, and advanced functions on the XTB platform.

Finally, the Premium section is filled with Premium content and includes tools, tips, and advice from top traders in addition to advanced trading strategies and techniques. You can access most of the educational materials on XTB without logging in or registering, but the Premium section does require you to log in.

If you prefer, you can also browse the courses in the Education section by subject instead of level. This way, you get to choose from an MT4 Tutorial, an xStation Tutorial, an Introduction to CFDs, Fundamental Analysis, or an Introduction to Forex.

At the time of writing, the Basic category has 27 lessons to choose from and covers topics like using specific platforms in great detail, risk management, an introduction to types of charts, resistance and support, trading the trend, why macroeconomics matters, global sessions, and more. There are 15 Intermediate lessons at the time of writing, including more advanced how-tos on specific platform features, market sentient and positioning, stocks, cryptocurrencies, intermarket correlation, and more.

There is also a useful search feature on the Education page so you can easily find a topic that you wish to learn more about.

Depending on the language and region you choose when viewing the XTB website, you will also notice live webinars. These allow you to connect with XTB’s market experts and learn or review skills from the comfort of your home.

XTB FAQ Section

Like most brokers, XTB has a FAQ section, also known as its Knowledge Base. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, the FAQ section does not information on the International Page. It is labeled as “Soon” with categories for Our Platforms, Your Account, and Trading Glossary. While the FAQ section will likely be useful in the future, the lack of content at the moment is a significant disadvantage for XTB over other trading platforms.

Without FAQs in place, the chances of needing to contact customer support to understand a process or resolve a minor issue increases. This may be a hassle for clients and likely also increases the wait times for support as more people contact support for minor issues.

In the meantime, we suggest that if you cannot find an FAQ section with information on the XTB website dedicated to your region, that you visit that of another region. The version of XTB targeted towards United Kingdom clients in English, for example, currently has a reasonably detailed FAQ section with a total of 31 categories and 51 topics.

XTB Affiliate Program


XTB offers both an affiliate program and an Introducing Broker (IB) program. With the affiliate program, you get marketing tools from XTB that you can use to advertise on your platform or website.

Visitors get redirected to XTB via a unique link. You can then earn money for successful referrals, doing so on a monthly basis. This method can earn you as much as $600 per trader.

The Introducing Broker program acts as a partnership. You refer your clients to XTB and they open up and account and start trading. You will then receive a commission based on the trading volumes that your clients generate.

XTB Customer Support

The client support from XTB is very highly rated, having earned a five-star rating from its clients. Part of this is due to the friendly, prompt service, while another aspect is XTB’s previously mentioned desire to build long-term relationships with its clients. The support team is available 24 hours a day Sunday through Friday. This makes it easy to get help exactly when you need it.

The fact that everyone gets their own personal account manager is also incredibly useful as this allows for personalized service and a simple point of contact.

Is XTB Safe?


Since XTB is regulated, you can rest easy knowing that the broker holds all of its retail clients’ funds in a segregated account. This means that those funds never mix with the broker’s own funds. There are also additional measures in place, such as storing the funds in ring-fenced accounts separate from those of XTB. The use of segregated funds for client funds ensures that if something happens to XTB and the broker must file for bankruptcy, the client funds cannot be considered recoverable assets by XTB’s general creditors. Instead, the funds would have to be returned to the clients.

In the case of XTB clients in the United Kingdom who sign up via the UK version of XTB, there is additional fund protection via the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. This scheme, known as FSCS, provides insurance of up to £50,000 per person if the unlikely scenario occurs and XTB becomes insolvent.

XTB Security

All personal information that you submit to XTB remains safe with the company. All of the data passes through a secure SSL connection to prevent hackers from gaining access to it. Due to XTB’s regulation and authorization from various financial organizations around the world, you can count on the broker to maintain the highest level of security.

"Passwords are Dying: Here’s what’s Killing Them","For years, we’ve relied on passwords to protect our personal and financial information online. From banking to social media, passwords…","For years, we’ve relied on passwords to protect our personal and financial information online. From banking to social media, passwords have been the gatekeepers of our digital lives. But now, it’s time to admit that the era of passwords is coming to an end. With the rise of advanced technology and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, it’s clear that passwords are no longer sufficient to keep our data safe.

The problems with passwords are numerous. First and foremost, passwords are easily guessable, hackable, and can be stolen. Common passwords like “password123” or “qwerty” are notoriously weak, and even stronger passwords can easily be compromised by skilled hackers.

In fact, studies have shown that more than 80% of data breaches are due to weak passwords according to Verizon’s 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report.

Secondly, passwords are a hassle to remember. Most people use the same password across multiple accounts, which means that if one password is compromised, all of their accounts are at risk. Alternatively, people will use different passwords for each account, but then struggle to remember them all, resorting to pen and paper, sticky notes, and frequent password resets.

But perhaps the biggest problem with passwords is the trust gap that they create. When we enter our passwords online, we trust that the website or app is secure and that our information won’t be stolen or misused. Unfortunately, this trust is often misplaced. With the increasing frequency of data breaches and the prevalence of phishing scams, it’s hard to know who to trust online.

The Rise of AI

Contents [Show]

To top it off, the threat of AI to passwords is real and growing. As AI technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more sophisticated attacks on password security. Brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, social engineering attacks, and password cracking algorithms are all ways in which AI can be used to compromise passwords.

Brute force attacks involve using AI algorithms to try out various combinations of characters in a password until the correct one is found. With the ability to process large amounts of data quickly, AI can significantly speed up the process of cracking passwords. Similarly, dictionary attacks use AI to test a password against a pre-built list of commonly used passwords, dictionary words, and combinations of them. This is exacerbated by the speed of AI algorithms that can make these attacks more effective.

Social engineering attacks involve using AI to generate highly convincing phishing emails or messages that trick users into revealing their passwords, while password cracking algorithms quickly identify patterns in password data and predict likely combinations of characters. This can make it easier for attackers to guess passwords that are based on easily guessable patterns such as birthdays, names, or common phrases.

So, what’s the solution? The answer seemingly lies in Web3. By leveraging blockchain technology, decentralised platforms allow for secure and transparent transactions, creating a new model of fraud-prevention without the need for passwords.

Web3 Fraud Prevention

Web3 is rapidly making its way into the mainstream via new decentralised models that promise to replace outdated centralised technologies. The blockchain creates a trustless environment, where users can verify the authenticity of the transactions they are making. For example, instead of logging in with a password, Web3 uses private keys that are unique to each user. This private key is securely stored on the user’s device, and is used to verify their identity and authorise transactions.

This system seemingly eliminates the trust gap that exists with passwords, as users are no longer relying on a third party to keep their data safe. Instead, they are in complete control of their own data, and can verify the authenticity of any transaction before it takes place.

But as more and more people flock to these Web3 platforms, the need for comprehensive Web3 fraud prevention only becomes compounded. Unfortunately fraudsters are taking advantage of the lack of regulation and anonymity to commit scams and hack exchanges.  We see news of this on a daily basis.

The need for secure and transparent systems is perhaps even more important in Web3 – where individuals are told to trust nothing, and verify everything.

A Shift in the Value Chain

Fortunately, there is a solution. A number of Web3 models have been created with the intention of giving ownership and control back to the user without the need for passwords. Self is a decentralised trust network that has developed a unique approach to fraud prevention that combines transparency and automation to create a secure and trustworthy environment for Web3 transactions that makes us equal, powerful and safe.

Unlike traditional auditing, which can be prone to manipulation and deception, Self leverages technology to ensure that all entities involved in a transaction or interaction are precisely who they claim to be. This level of transparency is particularly effective in decentralised systems, where it is easier to ensure that all parties are accountable for their actions and data remains with the person it belongs to.

Many emerging Web3 platforms and networks believe in a shift in the value chain where consumers benefit from their own data rather than the companies that use this data. By utilising cryptography to enable decentralisation at scale, users can be assured of  the security and trustworthiness of the system – keeping data in their hands and not in anyone else’s.

Ultimately the era of passwords is coming to an end, and with the rise of advanced technology and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, it’s clear that passwords are no longer sufficient to keep our data safe. It’s time for passwords to be replaced by cryptography via robust Web3 fraud prevention platforms that offer a solution to the problem of online trust. The creation of a trustless environment where users have more control over their data and online interactions is closer than it has ever been. While Web3 may still be in its nascence,  It is time to embrace this new technology and say goodbye to the relics of passwords once and for all.","https://blockonomi.com/passwords-are-dying-heres-whats-killing-them/"
"SEC’s Crack Down On DeFi: All Trading Platforms Subject To Securities Laws","SEC is targeting DeFi as the battleground of technology and regulation. Gary Gensler’s hardline stance against cryptocurrencies is not something…","SEC is targeting DeFi as the battleground of technology and regulation.

Gary Gensler’s hardline stance against cryptocurrencies is not something new. Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reopened the comment period for public input on proposed amendments to the definition of an exchange.

More Trouble for Cryptos

Contents [Show]

The SEC’s revisiting of the exchange definition aimed at including DeFi in its definition of the securities exchange. The proposal is part of a more extensive effort to formalize the regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry.

There are several important considerations to bear in mind concerning decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi operates on smart contracts and follows a permissionless model, wherein participants can engage without requiring approval from a centralized entity.

Additionally, the proposed amendments by the SEC pertain exclusively to centralized exchanges, which are subject to regulatory oversight. With this stance, there may be even more issues coming for the DeFi space.

DeFi may fall within the definition of an exchange, which raises significant questions about its regulatory classification and potential implications for future regulation.

The SEC Wants More Power

The agency is known for being proactive in its regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. The SEC has been closely monitoring the emerging field and its impact on the financial markets in recent years.

The crypto industry has long been seeking regulatory clarity from the SEC to navigate the complex landscape of cryptocurrencies and avoid regulatory pitfalls. However, recent developments indicate that the agency is unlikely to provide tailored regulations.

Instead of creating new regulations for the crypto industry, the SEC is focusing on targeted adjustments to its existing securities regulations to ensure that crypto is held to the same standards as other financial assets.

The proposal faces strong opposition from several regulators.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has raised concerns about applying existing regulations to DeFi platforms. She stressed in a separate statement that Gensler’s move “sends a message that we are uninterested in facilitating innovation and competition in the financial markets and instead seek to protect incumbents.”

Commissioner Peirce, a vocal advocate for innovation in the crypto industry, expressed worries that imposing traditional regulations on DeFi could result in confusing and unworkable standards for network participants, including blockchain miners and validators.

She also questioned whether DeFi participants would be able to meet the registration criteria of exchanges or broker-dealers and whether such registrations were necessary for the unique nature of DeFi.

This contrasts with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s long-standing argument that most crypto assets should be subject to securities laws and that cryptocurrency exchanges should adhere to the same regulations as traditional trading platforms.

Potential Impacts

The proposed amendments have raised concerns among the decentralized finance (DeFi) community. If implemented, these amendments could have significant implications for DeFi platforms.

One potential impact is the requirement for DeFi platforms to register with the SEC. Currently, DeFi operates in a permissionless and decentralized manner without the need for approval from a central authority.

However, the proposed amendments could change this landscape, mandating DeFi platforms to register with the SEC as traditional exchanges, subjecting them to regulatory oversight.

Under the proposed amendments, compliance with investor protection laws could also be required for DeFi platforms. This could entail additional compliance measures, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, to protect investors and prevent financial crimes.

Moreover, the proposed amendments may also impose reporting requirements on DeFi platforms. This could include regular financial reporting, disclosures of risks, and other information that would be required by the SEC.

Such reporting obligations could add administrative burdens to DeFi platforms, potentially impacting operational efficiency and cost structure.","https://blockonomi.com/secs-crack-down-on-defi-all-trading-platforms-subject-to-securities-laws/"
"ETH Over $2,000: Shanghai Upgrade Brings In Positive Momentum","The Ethereum ecosystem looks bullish after the Shanghai upgrade, and staking has seen steady growth. The recent upgrade laid the…","The Ethereum ecosystem looks bullish after the Shanghai upgrade, and staking has seen steady growth. The recent upgrade laid the groundwork for future network scalability and performance developments.

The Ethereum network underwent a major milestone after successfully deploying the Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella, at epoch 194.048 on April 13.

The upgrade released the withdrawal of ETH staking, which had been locked since December 2020. EIP-4895 was an important proposal in this upgrade, enabling the release of a significant amount of staking ETH for Ethereum 2.0 after The Merge.

A Lot of ETH is Moving

Contents [Show]

Over 18.1 million ETH, valued at around $34.5 billion at 1.1917 USD/ETH, had been locked and represented 15% of the ETH in circulation.

Concerns about the massive withdrawals and their impact on the market amounted before the big event. The entire 18.5 million ETH in staking contract would be withdrawn. Only about 57,600 ETH would be withdrawn daily.

Furthermore, major third-party stakeholders like Lido, Coinbase, and Binance would only process user staking requests next week or extend the period to the following month, mitigating the withdrawal force.

Since the activation of Shanghai, nearly 318.38 ETH has been withdrawn from staking, equivalent to $669 million.

However, over 204.58 ETH has been staked, indicating that many validators withdrew staking ETH and moved it to liquid staking protocols like Lido or Rocket Pool for more liquidity flexibility.

Looking Good

ETH saw the strongest growth after Shanghai, surging by more than 10% to a new peak of $2,128, the highest since mid-May 2022 after the LUNA-UST crash. LDO and RPL prices followed suit, boosted by the momentum from Ethereum. Other major coins also experienced an upward trend of 3% to 8%.

Recent market trends and positive momentum suggest that an altcoin season has begun. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has also surpassed the $1.284 billion threshold, which has not been seen since mid-May 2022.

While the crypto community is buzzing with excitement about the recent surge in altcoin prices, the wait for unstaking might not be over yet with major centralized exchanges.

Leading exchange Huobi is waiting to withdraw over 40,000 ETH from its staking service, accounting for about 5.1% of the total in the queue. Meanwhile, Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, has initiated withdrawal requests for 94,749 ETH, representing 10.8% of the total.

The biggest concern is Kraken – Kraken’s withdrawal request is the largest since the Ethereum upgrade in Shanghai on Wednesday. The platform registered a request to withdraw 556,272 ETH worth approximately$1.17 a billion.

According to blockchain data tracker Nansen, it accounts for 63.3% of all staked ETH in the withdrawal queue. Previously, the SEC fined Kraken $30 million for not signing up for its staking programs and forced the platform to close its service for US users in February.

Market Getting Firmer?

Glassnode’s findings suggest that the upgrade’s impact will not likely make a severe impact on the price of Ethereum.

The analysis states an estimated 170,000 ETH would be withdrawn from the Beacon Chain and returned to the market. Validators are expected to sell 100,000 ETH to take profits, while the remaining 70,000 ETH will be kept as liquidity.

These figures indicate that the upgrade has not caused a significant exodus from the Ethereum ecosystem. According to the data company, even in the extreme case of all the 170,000 ETH being sold upon withdrawal, the selling volume would still fall within Ethereum’s average weekly inflows.

The report also disclosed that third-party staking service users are the main beneficiaries of the unlocked ETH. Nevertheless, given the absence of interest on the original deposit, they are also the segment with the least demand for selling.","https://blockonomi.com/eth-over-2000-shanghai-upgrade-brings-in-positive-momentum/"
"Twitter Partners With eToro: Paving The Way For Crypto Mainstream Adoption?","Twitter users are now able to access real-time data on eToro. According to CNBC, Twitter has partnered with eToro, allowing…","Twitter users are now able to access real-time data on eToro.

According to CNBC, Twitter has partnered with eToro, allowing users to access real-time market data on the social trading and investing platform.

The new feature enables users to see real-time prices and provides access to various financial instruments and assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.

eToro is a multi-asset investment platform renowned for its copy-trading service, allowing investors to replicate the strategies of top-performing public traders.

More Access for eToro Customers

In addition to stocks and cryptocurrencies, the new feature unlocks access to other financial instruments and assets. eToro is a multi-asset investment platform known for its copy-trading service, allowing investors to replicate top-performing public traders.

To perform this feature, users can type $Cashtags, and the app will show the real-time stock price or crypto price. For example, to check the price of Bitcoin, you can type $BTC, or to view Tesla’s price, you can type $TSLA.

In December last month, Twitter reportedly enabled chart displays for Bitcoin and Ethereum, in addition to price charts of the S&P 500 and stock prices of some companies, including Tesla.

The charts resulted from keyword searches “cashtag,” “$coin,” or “#coin,” which came from Trading View’s data.

The new partnership with eToro will enhance the capabilities as Twitter users can now track and monitor market data from multiple instruments and asset classes. Users can also click the “view on eToro” button and navigate the eToro platform to trade and invest.

The move marked a massive deal for both Twitter and Elon Musk. Since Musk took over the social empire, speculations about Twitter’s makeover have been around, with some shedding light on the potential integration of Dogecoin into Twitter.

Speaking with CNBC, Yoni Assia, eToro’s CEO, said the increasing number of users interacting on Twitter to learn about the market over the past three months presented an opportunity.

Assia added:

“There is very high-quality content, real-time content on financial analysis of companies and what’s happening around the world. We believe this partnership will enable us to reach those new audiences [and] connect better the brands of Twitter and eToro.”

Bring Crypto To The Masses

The cryptocurrency industry has experienced rapid growth recently, and Twitter has been at the forefront of this revolution. It has become a hub for the crypto community, providing a one-stop destination for crypto enthusiasts, NFT collectors, market analysts, and new investors to stay up-to-date with the latest trends, news, and developments in the industry.

Under Musk’s leadership, Twitter aims to revolutionize how we use social media by transforming it into a super-app offering an array of services beyond just tweeting.

Musk’s vision for Twitter is to create a platform combining the functionality of multiple apps into one, making it easier for users to access all the services they need without switching between different applications.

This includes instant messaging, banking, travel, and much more.

The recent change in Twitter’s corporate name to X Corp and the integration of a shell company with that name highlights Musk’s commitment to making Twitter a super-app. This move will help to consolidate

Twitter’s position as a significant player in the tech industry and pave the way for new and innovative features to be added to the platform.

Last week, Twitter made headlines again when it changed its logo from the iconic blue bird to the Shiba Inu with the exact figure of the Dogecoin logo.

The move caught the crypto community’s attention and sent the price of $DOGE soaring by 37% before retracting. While the change was short-lived, it demonstrates Twitter’s ability to impact the crypto market and the power of social media as a driving force in the industry.

Dogecoin has again benefited from the news – $DOGE surged by 4.98% shortly after the partnership announcement.","https://blockonomi.com/twitter-partners-with-etoro-paving-the-way-for-crypto-mainstream-adoption/"

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this free trial to understand how the platform works before you opt-in for a paid version.

Basic Plan at $19 a Month

The basic account comes with all standard features and allows you to engage in unlimited exchanges. However, there is a trading limit of $25,000.

Note: Bistgap does not charge any fees for any trades. All of its services are included in the monthly subscription fee. Any fees on transactions are imposed by the respective exchange you are trading on.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

Another major plus is the wealth of resources made available on the platform, and the Support Section contains a number of guides, and FAQs that help people get to grips with the most important issues.

Furthermore, the team maintain a blog that details a number of key concepts for newer traders, and also provide further assistance via their Telegram group, YouTube Channel, and other social media channels, and members can gain access to the 3Commas Discord from inside their accounts.

"The Different Modes of Minting by LFi","Minting crypto refers to the process of creating new digital coins by verifying data. When newly minted cryptocurrency is added…","Minting crypto refers to the process of creating new digital coins by verifying data. When newly minted cryptocurrency is added to circulation for trading, it is referred to as “minting,” similar to how governments mint new physical coins. LFi is a decentralized network that explores and engages in the future of wealth creation, through its own blockchain and DAO-driven ecosystem. Is LFi bringing something new to the cryptocurrency world with its minting?

Minting on LFi

Contents [Show]

The LFi platform employs three distinct layers for minting, namely Proof of Stake, Proof of Coverage, and Proof of Action. At the first layer, Proof of Stake, users can become validators of the LFi Chain and receive LFi tokens as rewards for every block they validate.

The second layer, Proof of Coverage, involves users contributing to the growth of LFi’s Internet of People by either owning or renting hardware, activating licenses, or sharing IPFS. These participants can receive daily rewards for their contributions.

Finally, in the third and final layer, Proof of Action, users can mint tokens by carrying out specific actions such as learning about the LFi platform, watching ads, and more.

Different Ways to Mint on LFi
Minting Hardware

LFi partnered with LYOTECH LABS to offer two types of high-powered minting hardware. Once purchased, they can be set up at home and they will start minting LFi tokens for you. The availability of the minting hardware will be announced soon.

Cloud Minting

If you have no space at home where you can put your minting hardware, you can access the cloud minting program of LFi. Here, you can rent minting hardware, which is going to be placed in a remote location. This will prevent the hassle of dedicating a spot at home for your minting hardware and checking it regularly to avoid overheating and other technical issues.

LFi One

LFi One is a cutting-edge smartphone and minting hardware rolled into one. It supports a powerful minting application native to the LFi platform, enableing you to mint tokens while the device is inside your pocket.

More Ways to Mint, More Reasons to Start

From different types of consensus mechanisms to various kinds of minting methods, there’s enough reasons for you to begin minting LFi tokens. The LFi ecosystem is a decentralized platform that boasts promising use cases, which may help in increasing the value of the LFi token. It is not too late to start. Joining the revolution now!

"FTX Eyes Relaunching Exchange After Recovering $7.3 Billion Assets","On a day when the attention was fixed on the Shanghai upgrade, FTX made a major announcement that it had…","On a day when the attention was fixed on the Shanghai upgrade, FTX made a major announcement that it had recovered $7,3 billion in assets. However, experts caution that the news may not be as bullish as it seems.

After navigating a rocky period, cryptocurrency exchange FTX announced today that it had recovered $7,3 billion in assets, as the legal team behind FTX Sullivan & Cromwell reported. This presents a significant increase from the approximately $4.8 billion in scheduled assets reported in the March filing.

Following the announcement, FTX is setting sights on various future options, including relaunching its exchange. However, the final decision remains on hold. We won’t know of the exchange will emerge from bankruptcy for some time to come.

A Possible Way Forward

According to Andy Dietderich, FTX’s chief legal officer, reopening the exchange is one of the many possibilities the company is considering. The plan would require raising a significant amount of capital, and internally, they are debating whether that funding should come from FTX real estate or a third party.

The breakdown of $7,3 billion assets includes $2 billion in cash, $4.3 billion in crypto, $300 million in securities, and $600 million in investments. However, it’s important to note that these recovered assets will be frozen pending court approval of a customer payment plan.

The recovery of FTX’s assets marks a significant milestone in its efforts to overcome its bankruptcy challenges. This also gives hope to FTX’s customers eagerly waiting to receive their funds.

In fact, if this plan is successful, there may not be large losses for asset holders.

FTX CEO John J. Ray III hinted at the possibility of reviving the bankrupt exchange in a January interview after the company completes paying customers and creditors. With the recovery of substantial assets and plans to reboot the exchange, FTX is positioning itself for a solid comeback to the market.

In his first interview since taking over FTX in November 2022, FTX’s new CEO addressed the accusations of fraud and misappropriation of customer funds against the previous FTX leadership. Despite these challenges, Ray expressed confidence in FTX’s technology platform and its potential for revival.

A Rough Road to This Moment

One of the former leading exchanges, FTX, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 14, 2022, following its sudden collapse. The company’s collapse led to an investigation by regulators in various jurisdictions, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

FTX’s bankruptcy was one of the most shocking events in the crypto market in 2022. Following FTX’s declaration, other crypto companies like Celsius, Voyager Digital, and BlockFi also filed for bankruptcy to secure the business.

Ray has a reputation for restructuring companies in crisis. He emphasized that the company has no problems with corporate governance. The CEO affirmed that some entities still see business potential in FTX.

Over the last few months, Ray’s team reportedly combined FTX data to locate where customer assets are kept since the exchange does not have a ledger of these activities or records of the transactions made.

Current employees have been calling FTX-invested companies to find out how much FTX was buying and the nature of those companies’ business.

Sam Bankman-Fried previously criticized how the new boss took over the company and disagreed with FTX’s filing for bankruptcy protection.

The FTX token price surged from $1.32 to $2.80, an increase of over 112%. However, since the bankruptcy filing, the token price has remained between $1 and $2.

Despite the uncertainty that surrounds the future of FTX, Ray’s leadership and efforts to revive the company have shown some promise. However, some experts remain cautious and warn that the crisis of trust that followed the company’s downfall may be too significant to resolve entirely.","https://blockonomi.com/ftx-eyes-relaunching-exchange-after-recovering-7-3-billion-assets/"
"Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Is Here: What It Means for Ethereum Investors","The Shanghai upgrade is here! Ethereum’s highly-anticipated hardfork set to implement several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) is a critical step…","The Shanghai upgrade is here!

Ethereum’s highly-anticipated hardfork set to implement several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) is a critical step between the Merge and Surge phases in Ethereum’s scaling roadmap.

The Shanghai upgrade will allow stakers to unlock their staked ETH. However, there are concerns among some investors about a possible sell-off in ETH when the upgrade occurs.

The transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake through the critical update “The Merge” has caused concern about the potential issues arising from the long-awaited change.

With approximately 18 million Ethereum (valued at roughly $34 billion) staked on the network, equivalent to about 15% of the total supply, some are worried that holders may sell their Ethereum to take profits, leading to a drop in ETH price.

A Staker’s Paradise

Contents [Show]

Of the over 18 million ETH staked, about 5.67 million are staked on Lido’s LSD platform. According to Nansen statistics, Lido, Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance are the four largest Ethereum validators, accounting for nearly 60% of the total amount of ETH staked.

However, a February report by on-chain provider CryptoQuant suggests that there will not be a massive Ethereum sell-off. Most of the ETH staked is in losses, given the price of ETH was over $4,500 in October last year.

To wit,

“Typically, selling pressure arises when participants have extreme profits, which is not the case for staked ETH currently. Additionally, the most profitable staked ETH was staked less than a year ago and has not seen significant profit-taking events in the past.”

While there are valid concerns about the impact of the Shanghai upgrade and the Merge on the ETH market, many reports suggest that a massive sell-off is unlikely.

It’s noteworthy that there will be a withdrawal limit. The currently locked Ethereum cannot be withdrawn simultaneously, and it may take up to a year to withdraw the total amount of staked Ethereum.

It All Went Fine

The upgrade is scheduled for April 12 – it’s also CPI day. The market is anticipating that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep the 0.25-point interest rate, which may lead to more optimism and a potential opportunity for the ETH price to rise.

In addition, the successful upgrade will encourage investors to participate in ETH staking, particularly with the rise of Liquid Staking platforms.

Ethereum has a low stake ratio compared to other major blockchains. This leaves room for more staking and buying opportunities.

However, the Ethereum Shanghai event is not without risk, as the financial and cryptocurrency markets continue to experience a prolonged downtrend.

While the Fed may still be lenient on rate hikes, high-interest rates could cause capital pressure on companies and investors, potentially negatively impacting the ETH price instead of increasing staking positions.

Post-Shanghai

One of the key indicators of Ethereum’s potential for growth is the decrease in daily Net ETH Issuance and the surge in network activity. This indicates that deflation is much more likely on Ethereum as users engage in trading and other DeFi activities.

This trend is expected to continue, with more users and developers flocking to the platform as its capabilities expand and mature.

Ethereum’s roadmap after the Shanghai upgrade includes the Verge, which will introduce Verkle trees to increase scalability. This upgrade will allow the platform to handle more transactions per second, crucial for its continued growth and success.

In addition, there are plans to tackle other issues, such as statelessness and data sharding, which will further improve Ethereum’s scalability and functionality.

Data sharding is another key feature expected to improve Ethereum’s scalability. This technology will enable the platform to process transactions more efficiently by partitioning the data into smaller subsets, which can then be processed in parallel.

It will allow Ethereum to handle a much larger number of transactions per second without compromising security or decentralization.","https://blockonomi.com/ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-is-here-what-it-means-for-ethereum-investors/"
"Fleek Network: Decentralized Content Delivery Network","In 2019, Fleek was founded under the name of Terminal, a development platform for Ethereum. A year later, it was…","In 2019, Fleek was founded under the name of Terminal, a development platform for Ethereum. A year later, it was rebranded to Fleek and transitioned to becoming a Web3 infrastructure platform that offers IPFS storage infrastructure and hosting of static websites.

The platform aims to give developers an easy-to-use and abstracted experience when building Web3 apps, abstracting the use of Web3 infrastructure to have seamless deployments and storage, similar to the experience you’d see in Web2 today.

Fleek Network – The Decentralized Edge Network

Contents [Show]

Web2 allows you to cover all your infrastructure needs from single sources, in a unified developer environment and experience.

Meanwhile, this is impossible in Web3 as all providers and pieces of the puzzle are spread out, have their own integration and use experiences, are disconnected from each other, and do not always have their use-case laid out for the user.

IPFS itself is not specifically built to host websites, which is an example. So, Fleek’s role is to abstract and surface use cases on top of those technologies like video streaming modules on Livepeer, SSR on Akash, or Fleek Network.

Fleek Network is the company’s 2nd project, a decentralized content and application delivery network, delivering edge services like computation, SSR, and dn-oriented services like cache/acceleration.

What Is Fleek Doing to Help Web3?

Currently, most popular Web3 apps and use cases use Cloudflare for accelerating their app and content as users are not tolerating slow loading apps/content.

Because Web3 protocols don’t incentivize performant delivery of content directly from their networks, users are forced to stick to a performant cache layer such as Cloudflare in between all these protocols and their apps.

Fleek Network is built for anyone who wants both fast and trustless content acceleration.

Also, the usage of the network will be fully transparent and publicly available for the world to leverage. Therefore, all content will be IPLD-based and content addressable, creating a public record, much like how smart contracts bring radical transparency to financial transactions.

The user would have access to an SDK and browser app experience to leverage Fleek Network’s cache and computation.

The user submits files or data to be cached by the network, and the network outputs an endpoint/URL that the user will consume somewhere in an application or project.

In the terms of computation, the user would be able to leverage Fleek Network to execute compute tasks and operations (e.g. Server Side Rendering, data processing), and the network would utilize the decentralized edge network of nodes to performantly execute the code/instruction and return the user their needed output.

Fleek Network will play a very important role in the decentralization of the CDN and edge layer, ending the Cloudflare and AWS dependence on Web3.

On the other hand, new consensus methods continue to drive Web3 innovation such as some of the better-known consensus methods like PoW or PoS. However, fair exchange is still a challenging problem in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks where two parties exchange information and want to be protected.

Fleek Network uses secret symmetric encryption keys to create a commitment and Shamir’s Secret Sharing algorithm to share every node’s secret key with the consensus committee members. So, they also can be used to resolve disputes.

Shamir’s Secret Sharing is one of the most popular cryptographic algorithms allowing a secret to be split into multiple parts, or shares, and distributed among multiple parties.

The secret can only be reconstructed by combining a certain minimum number of shares and any subset of shares fewer than this minimum number reveals no information about the secret.

Fleek Network’s symmetric encryption key is not only used to encrypt data but also can be split into multiple shares.

Therefore, if there is a dispute or failure to share the decryption key, committee members can share the shares of the decryption key with the client. The client can reconstruct the decryption key independently with a certain minimum number of shares available.

As a result, this makes an additional layer of security and redundancy to Fleek Network’s fair exchange mechanism and the data exchange is more fair and secure.

NFAs

Well, you’ve heard of NFTs, so what about NFAs?

NFAs are implemented based on the ERC721 NFT standard holding the on-chain metadata for everything about your app, including name, domain, build history, infra endpoints, and many more.

However, unlike most NFTs, NFA’s will probably update frequently. This is a new standard for placing apps and infrastructure on-chain.

Today, Web3 apps are still using centralized solutions. This not only leaves Web3 frontends vulnerable to censorship and hacks but also creates financial and even criminal liability for Web3 projects and their founders.

In this case, NFAs allow smart contracts to own and control all of the infrastructure and assets that encompass your Web3 app.

You can mint your app as an NFA, meaning transferring the app. As so, anything you’d usually do/own/pay for as a founder can now be automated to the NFA. In other words, you can do with NFAs the same as people are doing with NFTs.

In addition, you can own or update the content hash on your app that your ENS name or other domain points to with NFAs.

Furthermore, it also includes the ability to pay for your apps’ decentralized hosting, storage, delivery, databases, or RPC endpoints. It can be said that NFA is supporting bringing novelty and usefulness to the new primitive of the ecosystem.

The combination of Fleek Network and NFA is to remove the control over infrastructure to the NFA itself and out of the company/team’s hand as well as allow the decentralized hosting and creation of access points.

Therefore, users have decentralizing control and can sell or transfer their projects with full control of the infra. In addition, users can mint a copy of the NFA and point to their hosting/infrastructure to create an access point to that application’s backend.

What Fleek Network Offers

As said, you will have access to an SDK and browser app experience to leverage Fleek Network’s cache and computation.

You can submit files or data to be cached by the network, and the network outputs an endpoint/URL that the user will consume somewhere in an application or project.

Also, you can leverage Fleek Network to execute compute tasks and operations and the network will use the decentralized edge network of nodes to performantly execute the code/instruction and return your needed output.

Furthermore, node operators can join the network by running node servers, staking many tokens in the network, and providing computing, storage, cache, etc, as well as validation in the network itself.

They are the spine of the network, and the ones that provide the resources for it to operate to users. In return, they will receive rewards for these services based on their throughput, quality, and behavior.

Fleek: The Takeaway

Fleek could be better than existing tech due to the superior infrastructure, but also a sandbox experience that connects all decentralized protocols into a single experience.

Centralized CDNs and Edge providers like Cloudflare and AWS, there is no decentralized competitor on edge live today like what Fleek Network does.

With Fleek, there are loads of Web3 options, and it is all build on leading decentralized infrastructure. With new ideas come new opportunities!","https://blockonomi.com/fleek-network/"

After moving around $28,000 in the last few days, the flagship cryptocurrency climbed, breaching the $30,000 mark.

Previous signals suggested a potential surge, and investors were also in bullish momentum. But some analysts caution that old support levels must be retested first.

Bitcoin’s volatility is low. It strengthens the chance that it may make a further rebound. Bitcoin is trading above $30,000, at least for now.

While 2022 was rough for Bitcoin, it looks like 2023 has been a lot kinder. While we don’t know if this fair weather will continue. Bitcoin bulls are happy for now!

Macro Madness!

Contents [Show]

One of this week’s highlights is the CPI and PPI data release, potentially impacting the crypto market. On Wednesday, the US Bureau of Labor will drop the March consumer price index (CPI), and the market is waiting to see if inflation will decrease further.

The US Federal Reserve (Fed) on March 22 raised interest rates by 0.25 basic points, giving a cautious view on the current banking crisis and signaling that a rate hike is ending.

Last month, a series of banking crises put the Fed in a challenging position between fighting inflation and stabilizing finance. However, the Fed decided to stick to its vital responsibility.

The correlation between Bitcoin and gold is stronger than between Bitcoin and Nasdaq. According to a recent report, the inverse correlation between BTC and the US dollar is also rapidly dissipating.

Bitcoin Holders Are Patient

The number of people holding Bitcoin is rising, with an increasing number of investors and traders viewing it as a viable long-term investment option. Many of these Bitcoin holders see it as a potential store of value that can protect their wealth from inflation and currency devaluation.

According to data compiled by the crypto analytics platform Glassnode, more than half of all Bitcoin in circulation has not been touched for two years. Crypto influencer Anthony Pompliano noted that 53% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply has been inactive in the last two years, a new record high for this metric.

According to Pompliano, nearly 29% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply has been inactive over the past 5 years, totaling over 5.6 million BTC worth around $158 billion.

Around 2.7 million BTC worth $76 billion has not been touched in a decade. There are two potential scenarios: either investors experienced significant losses, or they accumulated their holdings.

Some community members believe these investors bought Bitcoin at an all-time high and are waiting for the right time to sell.

Meanwhile, “Bitcoin” recently became the most searched term in the United States, surpassing other popular keywords such as Donald Trump and Elvis Presley.

BTC is Hot

Recent search trends in the United States show that “Bitcoin” has become the most popular search term, surpassing Donald Trump and Elvis Presley. This may be due to the announcement by the United States Federal Reserve regarding the launch of the FedNow payments system in July.

Additionally, the number of crypto wallets holding at least one Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, nearing the one million mark, as reported by the cryptocurrency tracking platform LookIntoBitcoin.

The total number of Bitcoin holders has been rising at the fastest rate since early 2021 when the price of BTC first exceeded $64,000.

The crypto analytics platform Santiment shared a chart indicating that the total number of addresses holding any amount of Bitcoin has reached 46.16 million recently.

The chart shows a similar pattern despite the current price being over 55% lower than during January-April 202d.

The team at Santiment suggests that the rising number of people “hodling” Bitcoin could be attributed to crypto traders becoming increasingly content with holding onto their digital assets for the long term.","https://blockonomi.com/bitcoin-surpasses-30000-ahead-of-us-cpi-report/"
"ECB President Admits That CBDCs Poised To Maintain Transactional Control","A new video has recently gained significant attention for shedding light on the potential impact of a central bank digital…","A new video has recently gained significant attention for shedding light on the potential impact of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) on individual financial transactions and privacy.

On April 6, 2023, Watcher Guru, a leading news source for cryptocurrency, shared a video “featuring” a conversation between European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and a Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky impersonator.

Lagarde didn’t realize it was a prank video and expressed her desire for a digital euro.

Too Late Now!

Significantly, the ECB President came clean during the discussion that Europe’s central bank digital currency (digital euro) will be poised to maintain transactional control.

The ECB has been conducting two-year research on the feasibility of a digital euro. The investigation ends in September. In the clip, Lagarde said the decision wouldn’t be made until October 23.

She stressed the need to issue a digital euro in light of the current situation. The President listed China’s yuan and Russia’s currency as two unfriendly countries’ currencies that Europe should not depend on.

In addition, she either voiced opposition to friendly currencies, which are ‘activated by private corporate entities’ like Facebook or Google.

The video gained significant attention on social media, with many expressing concern about Lagarde’s comments on the potential for control over people and payments.

It has been revealed that the video was a prank, with Lagarde speaking more candidly than usual, believing she was talking to Ukraine’s President. The pranksters behind the video have also targeted other public figures, including J.K. Rowling and George W. Bush.

She also acknowledged the potential for control over people and payments but suggested it would be limited control.

The President added that the European authorities are considering the minimum amount of transactions, but she also noted that terrorist attackers would benefit from small, anonymous transactions.

Not Very Popular

Lagarde’s statements have come under fierce criticism.

One of the main concerns surrounding the digital euro and other CBDCs is that it could monitor and control people’s spending, limit their financial freedom, and potentially erode privacy. The ECB President simply confirmed that threat.

On the other hand, some crypto members believe that her remarks may encourage people to turn towards decentralized currencies like Bitcoin.

ECB’s investigation into the digital euro is a significant development that could have major implications for the future of currency and payments.

Multiple press releases previously issued indicate that the Eurogroup has been regularly exchanging views on the key political dimensions of a digital euro since the investigation was launched.

However, future decisions have yet to be made on the possible issuance of a digital euro. If approved, a digital euro would represent a significant change with a range of potential challenges and benefits, and the ECB is carefully considering the effects of such a change.

There is no official timeline for introducing a digital euro, but the ECB has announced that it will release more information on the subject in mid-2023.

Some ECB members have voiced opposition to the digital euro, expressing concerns about its potential impact on the financial system and monetary policy.

In January 2021, ECB board member Fabio Panetta spoke about a digital euro’s potential risks and challenges, including privacy, cybersecurity, and financial stability.

He also noted that a digital euro could have implications for monetary policy, as it could change how money is held and used by individuals and businesses.

Similarly, in March 2021, another ECB board member, Jens Weidmann, stated that he was skeptical about the need for a digital euro and expressed concerns about its potential to undermine the traditional banking system.

Despite these concerns, the ECB has continued investigating the digital euro. President Christine Lagarde states that a decision about launching a digital euro will be made in Q3/2023.","https://blockonomi.com/ecb-president-admits-that-cbdcs-poised-to-maintain-transactional-control/"
"Venom: The Blockchain Network Built for Speed & Scalability","For a long time, blockchain technology has promised a new era of decentralization in which users will regain control of…","For a long time, blockchain technology has promised a new era of decentralization in which users will regain control of their digital lives in many ways.

Web3, DeFi, NFTs, and many other applications have certainly gained notoriety in the tech industry and popular culture but the promised revolution is still to be seen. This is what Venom Blockchain aims to change.

Envisioned by the Venom Foundation, the Venom blockchain is all about obliterating scalability issues, poor user experience, and high transaction costs, all while offering unmatchable security.

The team behind the network has also paid special attention to the regulatory aspect, ensuring that it complies with as most existing regulatory frameworks as possible, something essential for mass adoption.

The Abu Dhabi Global Market has also licensed Venom Foundation as a layer 0 blockchain crypto foundation, making the network the first to achieve such a standard. This means that developers enjoy more flexibility when it comes to creating complex and powerful applications.

This, coupled with a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, means that Venom offers many advantages to developers and organizations without requiring a complete restructuring of their existing models.

Venom: A Network for the People

Contents [Show]

Blockchain technology has brought many applications that can and have helped people all over the world in an unprecedented way. However, when applications like crypto, NFTs, and DeFi caught the world by storm, everything collapsed.

Such was the case of the NFT craze of 2021, when networks like Ethereum were unable to deal with the increased traffic, resulting in unprecedented congestion.

With an average transaction fee of $0.0002 and an infrastructure built around scaling, Venom ensures that no congestion will result in the average user being unable to transact when needed.

This, of course, means that whales won’t benefit from generating congestion to gain a competitive advantage when a speculative craze occurs, bringing equality to the ecosystem.

Venom is also able to process over 100,000 transactions per second with a scalability potential of up to 1 million, while also taking only between 0.2 – 0.3 seconds. Not only does this put Venom on par with some of the most popular blockchains in the space but above many of them.

Technology

Achieving performance and scalability like the ones Venom Blockchain offers is no easy feat and it wouldn’t be possible by using conventional methods.

The network does this by making use of the “Venom Asynchronous Architecture”, which uses the Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM) compiler instead of the Ethereum Virtual Machine

Venom has also built its infrastructure around 3 types of chains: Masterchains, Workchains, and Sharchains. The Masterchain severs as the foundation of Venom blockchain, allowing workchains to connect to it to take advantage of the validators’ collaborative effort to secure the network.

Workchains operate as layer-1 blockchains that can operate independently of other chains, effectively functioning as the networks developed by other blockchain projects.

This means entire constellations of smaller networks can coexist in the Venom ecosystem, each offering completely different services to its users.

Sharchains offer a way to distribute the validation of transactions by representing smaller slices of a blockchain state. These shardchains can divide automatically if the load on the network increases dramatically, ensuring that the load is evenly distributed and bottlenecks are avoided.

At launch, The Venom blockchain comprises of two distinct networks – the Masterchain and the Basechain. The Basechain, which serves as the platform for executing smart contracts, is the first layer-1 workchain specifically designed for end-users and supporting dApps. Both networks utilize the Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM) for smart contract execution, although the Basechain stands out for its ability to offer lower storage and execution fees compared to the Masterchain.

Scalability

The challenges faced by most blockchain networks are numerous, ranging from scalability issues to security flaws. This is the result of what has come to be known as the blockchain trilemma, which suggests that networks must sacrifice security, scalability, or decentralization.

The most pressing issue faced by blockchain at this time seems to be scalability. While blockchain networks can theoretically escalate indefinitely, doing so in real-time hasn’t been possible so far.

Venom aims to make this possible by being both horizontally and vertically scalable allowing for greater flexibility in terms of network growth and user adoption.

With this scalability comes the solution for 2 other major challenges: reliability and stability. Not only can Venom ensure that a high number of transactions can be processed as demand grows while keeping the price but it also allows the network to silo user behavior.

As Venom’s scalability is the result of a dynamic approach to node load by reallocating existing resources instead of modifying its standards’ thresholds, security flaws are not created in favor of performance.

This is essential for use cases like Decentralized finance (DeFi), cryptocurrency transactions, digital asset creation and management, governance, staking rewards, and much more.

Building Trust From The Get-go

The blockchain ecosystem is one in which hype can lead to painful life lessons for users and developers alike, especially when dubious investors are involved.

For this reason, the Venom Blockchain team has self-funded the totality of the Venom Foundation, preventing external pressure and interests from changing their vision.

The team also features names widely known across their respective industries.

Led by Venom’s Founder and Pontinova Circle Investment Group’s Managing Partner Dr. Kai-Uwe Steck, the board includes former BlackRock’s former CFI Peter Knez, Iceberg Capital’s Executive Chairman Mustafa Kheriba, and Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company’s CEO Osman Sultan.

Venom Blockchain has also established several key partnerships to bring value to the ecosystem. Some notable names are Hub71, DAO Maker, Hacken, Marketacross, DEveloper Dao, and DGC.

Each of these institutions brings something different to the table, offering multiple benefits in areas like strategic advice, technology, applications, security, and more.

A Blockchain For More Than Just dApps

With the rise of blockchain to public notoriety, many important applications of the technology seem to have been relegated more and more with every cycle.

Dapps, blockchain games, and NFT collectibles have now displaced valuable areas like Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Decentralized Finance, and many more.

While Venom Blockchain will support the most popular applications of blockchain technology due to its flexible and powerful nature, its scalability can offer much more.

Some of the applications that have been essential to guide the development of the blockchain have been Proof of Reserve Mechanisms, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), CBDC-backed stablecoins, trade finance, and many others.

This is backed by the blockchain’s resource governance model, which ensures that grants, bug bounty programs, and other incentives are readily available to developers.

It will not only drive security and organic growth in the long term as innovation takes place inside the ecosystem but also facilitate the process for existing projects looking to migrate to a truly scalable network.

Conclusion

The Venom Blockchain project offers a unique solution to the issues of scalability, high transaction costs, and poor user experience that have plagued many other blockchain networks.

With its unique combination of features, regulatory compliance, and strong partnerships, Venom is well-positioned to become a major player in the blockchain space. Blockchain needs to scale, and Venom is a part of the solution.

While it is true that other established networks do have a first-mover advantage, Venom comes at a critical time in which the blockchain community is looking for fresh approaches.

In addition, the team behind the Venom Blockchain project has demonstrated a clear commitment to continued innovation and improvement. With a great team, and unbeatable vision, Venom is well placed to grow.

Overall, the future looks bright for the Venom Blockchain project as it continues to gain traction and establish itself as a leader in the rapidly-evolving world of blockchain technology.","https://blockonomi.com/venom-blockchain/"

Ultimately, the Shanghai hard fork is a crucial milestone toward a more efficient, secure, and sustainable Ethereum network.

Unlocking Staked ETH

Contents [Show]

The upcoming Shanghai upgrade scheduled for April 12, 2023, has generated headlines with unlocking staked ETH. Shanghai upgrade will allow validators to withdraw their ETH deposited in staking.

Following last year’s Merge event, this will mark a significant milestone in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Ethereum (ETH) has shown strong momentum recently, outpacing Bitcoin (BTC) by a wide margin. According to on-chain data, ETH rose 4% to $1,861 at the press time, while BTC slipped 1.8%.

The recent uptrend in the ETH/BTC ratio is also a promising sign, although it remains within a multi-year consolidation range between 0.052 BTC and 0.085 BTC since the Spring of 2021.

It is worth noting that breaking out of this range could lead to significant movements and reactions from market participants.

ETH Profits Look Good

Data analytics platform Glassnode tweeted on Wednesday that the number of ETH investors holding at a loss has reached 10-month lows. This could indicate a positive signal for the overall health of the ETH market.

It will be interesting to see how the ETH/BTC ratio evolves over the coming weeks and whether ETH can maintain its impressive performance relative to BTC.

The move from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism opens plenty of opportunities. The Merge itself is simply the opening chapter.

The Shanghai upgrade, the next milestone post-merge, aims to bring several benefits to the Ethereum network, including improved scalability, security, and reduced energy consumption.

Additionally, the upgrade will introduce Ethereum Improvement Proposals, such as EIP-1559, which will help reduce transaction fees by introducing a more efficient fee market mechanism.

This could be a significant benefit to users and developers who have been struggling with high gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum network.

Another significant change the community can expect is the introduction of the EIP-3554. This proposal will delay the Ethereum network’s difficulty bomb, giving developers more time to finalize the transition to ETH 2.0.

Price Talk Post-Shanghai

There is a growing interest in the price of Ethereum after Shanghai. The upcoming release of staked ETH has led to speculation about possible dumps, as ETH holders can now withdraw their staked ETH at any time rather than being locked in for 2 years.

While some may fear a sell-off and price drop, it’s essential to note that not all staked ETH can be withdrawn immediately, and many stakers may prefer to continue holding and staking their tokens.

It’s worth noting that not all staked ETH is readily available for withdrawal. According to estimates, only 50,400 ETH or $95.7 million worth can be withdrawn daily. Validators on the Ethereum network must be aware of the different withdrawal processes and deadlines.

The Ethereum network currently has 18.1 million staked ETH, valued at $34.3 billion, with LidoDAO accounting for 31.2%. Lido Finance expects stETH withdrawals to be unavailable on the mainnet until mid-May.

This is due to ongoing code audits and a two-week safety margin being maintained.

The delays in withdrawals are primarily due to limitations put in place by developers to prevent a massive leak of ETH. Only 16 partial withdrawal requests, consisting only of staking rewards, can be processed approximately every 12 seconds.

In addition, full withdrawals, where validators withdraw entirely from the Ethereum blockchain, may also take a relatively long time.

Coinbase has announced that it will start accepting withdrawal requests 24 hours after the end of Shanghai. However, due to the expected high demand, the withdrawal process could take weeks or months.

Regardless of the price, ETH is getting stronger, and should be one of the most important blockchains going forward.","https://blockonomi.com/shanghai-upgrade-ethereum-outshines-bitcoin-as-enthusiasm-grows/"

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this free trial to understand how the platform works before you opt-in for a paid version.

Basic Plan at $19 a Month

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

"Will The US Return To The Gold Standard?","A gold standard could be the answer to US currency woes, but it may mean much higher crypto prices. US…","A gold standard could be the answer to US currency woes, but it may mean much higher crypto prices.

US Congress Rep Calls To Reinstate Gold Standard

Contents [Show]

Georgia Congress Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, or MTG, has recently made headlines with her call for the US to return to the gold standard.

Her bold statement was prompted by the news that the Federal Reserve plans to launch a digital payment system in July – the Fednow. Fednow is expected to facilitate the movement of money, bill payments, and transfers. It will also reduce transaction costs for consumers.

MTG disapproved of the Fed’s digital currency payment system, arguing that the US should not abandon the gold standard.

The Congresswoman’s remarks come when many countries shift away from the gold standard to embrace digital currencies.

US Has Been Off Gold Since 1971

MTG’s statement comes amid concerns about the global reliance on the US dollar and criticism of Operation Choke Point 2.0, which is aimed at curbing the use of cryptocurrencies in the US.

However, the launch of the Fed’s digital payment system clearly indicates that the US is moving towards digitizing currency.

The US adopted the gold standard in 1900, and it remained in place until 1971, when President Nixon announced that the US would abandon the gold standard. This move effectively ended the gold standard for the US and marked a significant shift in the global monetary system.

Since then, the US dollar has been a fiat currency, meaning any physical commodity does not back it.

The dollar’s value is determined by market forces, such as supply and demand, and is influenced by factors such as inflation, interest rates, and government policies.

The Dollar Looks Rough

The US dollar’s dominance is under a “gang attack.” There have been several moves by global countries to move away from the US dollar. Some of the most significant actions are from Russia and China.

Russia has been pushing to remove the dollar’s hold over its economy and financial markets to ease the impact of sanctions from the US and its allies. On the other hand, China has long been attempting to strengthen the power of its currency – the yuan.

China’s CBDC pilot – digital yuan – is also in the testing phase. China’s yuan is now accepted in Russia. Brazil also adopted yuan payments as an agreement was reached with China’s central bank in February. It could be another blow to the significant role of the US dollar.

Some experts believe that the yuan could become one of the global reserve currencies in the world. A think tank also suggests that countries may want to diversify away from the US dollar due to recent actions taken by the US, such as freezing Russia’s central bank reserves and disconnecting Russia from the interbank messaging.

In addition to those countries, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and others are moving away from pricing and trading energy in US dollars.

A Bitcoin Standard?

Taylor Greene’s proposal has sparked a debate among economists and lawmakers, with some arguing that the gold standard would provide a more reliable benchmark for the value of the US dollar.

In contrast, others believe it could be a little too late now, given the current state of the US economy and its role as a global economic powerhouse.

Some suggest the adoption of the Bitcoin standard for the US dollar. Proponents of this idea argue that Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, has many advantages over the current system of fiat currency that is subject to manipulation by governments and financial institutions.

Yet the volatility of Bitcoin remains a concern.

Bitcoin’s volatile nature makes it challenging to use as a stable currency for everyday transactions. Adopting a Bitcoin standard would require significant technical expertise and infrastructure, which could challenge the US government and financial institutions.","https://blockonomi.com/will-the-us-return-to-the-gold-standard/"
"P2P Crypto Exchange Paxful Shuts Down After 8 Years","One of the most recognized peer-to-peer crypto exchanges, Paxful, is closing its business after 8 years of operation. The announcement…","One of the most recognized peer-to-peer crypto exchanges, Paxful, is closing its business after 8 years of operation. The announcement came suddenly amid Binance FUDs, putting the future of P2P platforms in mounting concerns.

Regulatory pushback, staff departures, and shareholder’s lawsuit, left Paxful with few options but to take action.

Earlier today, Ray Youssef, the co-founder of Paxful, a prominent name in the emerging market, has announced that the marketplace will be suspending operations, citing regulatory challenges in the industry, particularly in the United States.

To wit,

“Paxful will be suspending the market place. We are not sure if it will be back.
While I cannot share the full story now, I can say that we unfortunately have had some key staff departures.”

Paxful is Gone For Now

Contents [Show]

Paxful’s closure comes as a surprise to customers, especially in Africa where the exchange was widely used.

While Youssef did not provide further details on the reasons for the sudden closure, some have speculated that regulatory challenges and staff departures may have played a role.

Paxful has been known for its social impact initiatives, including building schools in Africa with Bitcoin and reimbursing Gemini Earn customers. However, the exchange has recently experienced intermittent issues with wallet deposits and sendouts.

Despite the closure, Youssef assured customers that all funds were accounted for and encouraged them to withdraw their assets to self-custody or other exchanges.

He also mentioned a little-known new P2P platform called Noones from the Built With Bitcoin team as an alternative.

The Market is Still Under Pressure

Paxful joined the crypto race in the early days when limited belief in the future of cryptocurrency challenged mainstream adoption.

Since its first encounter in 2015, the company has grown rapidly over the years and has become a popular platform for buying and selling bitcoin globally.

The CEO of Paxful previously advised investors against leaving high-value cryptocurrencies on an exchange.

Youssef suggested that he is committed to protecting users’ funds and ensuring their safety. However, it’s important for investors to take control of their funds and not rely solely on the security measures provided by exchanges.

Ongoing Challenges for Crypto Exchanges

P2P cryptocurrency exchanges emerged as a popular alternative to traditional exchanges in the last few years, offering users greater flexibility and privacy in buying and selling cryptocurrencies.

However, these exchanges have faced a range of challenges and obstacles that have limited their growth and success in the market.

One of the primary challenges facing P2P crypto exchanges is the regulatory environment. Many jurisdictions lack clear regulations and guidelines for these platforms, leaving them vulnerable to legal and compliance risks.

Some governments have imposed strict regulations or outright bans on cryptocurrency trading, making it difficult for P2P exchanges to operate in those regions.

Others like the US remain uncertain to make any decisions regarding crypto regulations.

Another major challenge is the security concern. P2P exchanges typically rely on user-generated escrow accounts to facilitate trades, which can be vulnerable to fraud and hacking. This has led to instances of theft and loss of user funds, further eroding trust in the platform.

Additionally, P2P exchanges are susceptible to liquidity issues. Since the platform is entirely reliant on the supply and demand of users, fluctuations in trading volume can lead to significant price disparities or even a complete lack of trading opportunities.

Paxful’s sudden shutdown follows Localbitcoins shut down earlier this year.

On the same day that Paxful revealed its closure, Open Exchange (OPNX), a newly launched exchange, announced its opening. The exchange was founded by Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, co-founders of Three Arrows Capital.

Open Exchange offers users the unique opportunity to trade claims of bankrupt cryptocurrency companies.

The exchange has adopted the FLEX token as its native asset, offering users up to a 50% discount on trading fees. The price of FLEX has shot up following the launch.","https://blockonomi.com/p2p-crypto-exchange-paxful-shuts-down-after-8-years/"
"Nassim Taleb says Jordan Peterson Part of “Bitcoin Cartel”","The author of “The Black Swan,” Nassim Nicholas Taleb, has claimed that Jordan Peterson, a famed Canadian psychologist and author,…","The author of “The Black Swan,” Nassim Nicholas Taleb, has claimed that Jordan Peterson, a famed Canadian psychologist and author, is under the control of the “Bitcoin Cartel.”

Peterson recently expressed his support for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a retweet associated with the end of cash withdrawals in major Australian banks that led to the issuance of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), he said that Bitcoin fixed the problem of programmable CBDC.

Taleb No Longer Likes Bitcoin

Contents [Show]

Taleb claims that Peterson has been promoting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a part of a conspiracy orchestrated by the so-called Bitcoin cartel, a powerful group of investors who are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Taleb further claims that Peterson is being used as a tool by this group to promote their agenda.

To wit,

“I did not feel compelled to jump in & explain that Peterson talking about finance is slightly less sophisticated than a committee of antivaxx Canadian truckers lecturing on quantum field theory. But I need to warn the young victims that Peterson is owned by the Bitcoin cartel.”

As a psychologist and an author, Peterson can have valuable insights into human behavior and decision-making.

However, Peterson’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin is questionable since there is a credibility gap between his statement and his deep understanding of the markets, according to Taleb.

Not A Realistic View

Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s stance on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is somewhat mixed. He has been critical of Bitcoin’s volatility and lack of regulation in the past, calling it a “failed currency experiment.”

However, he has also acknowledged the potential of Bitcoin as a decentralized currency, stating that “Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.”

Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a well-known author but he has also been known to make provocative statements and use inflammatory language. This has led to criticism from some members of the public and other professionals in various fields.

In a separate statement, he harshly criticized the Lex Fridman podcast and declined an invitation to appear as a guest.

This led to Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, responding angrily to Taleb’s comments and labeling him as an “arrogant piece of human garbage.”

Talk About Bitcoin Cartel

The crypto community is diverse and opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies vary widely. Bitcoin has been a topic of discussion for years, with some people calling it a revolution and others calling it a form of manipulation.

While there may not be a formal cartel controlling Bitcoin, there are certainly large players in the market who have a significant impact on prices like whales.

Whales are individuals or organizations that hold large amounts of Bitcoin and can use their holdings to influence prices. If a whale decides to sell a large amount of Bitcoin, it can cause the price to drop, while buying can cause the price to rise.

Another factor that can influence Bitcoin prices is the behavior of miners. Bitcoin miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, and they are rewarded with new Bitcoins for their efforts.

However, the cost of mining can be high, and miners may decide to sell their Bitcoins to cover their expenses. This can put downward pressure on prices.

Taleb’s “attack” against Peterson has sparked controversy in the crypto community. Not everyone agrees with Taleb’s assessment.

Many Bitcoin supporters argue that the decentralized nature of the largest cryptocurrency makes it impossible for any one group to control it. They point out that Bitcoin is based on a public ledger called the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of users around the world.

Transactions are verified by these users, not by a central authority, which makes it difficult for anyone to manipulate the system.","https://blockonomi.com/nassim-taleb-says-jordan-peterson-part-of-bitcoin-cartel/"
"Sweatcoin: Incentivising Fitness With An Economy Based On The Value Of Movement","One of the biggest challenges in fitness is that humans are very impatient creatures, unable to motivate themselves long enough…","One of the biggest challenges in fitness is that humans are very impatient creatures, unable to motivate themselves long enough to enjoy the long-term rewards of being active. Keep fit and you’ll likely end up living a lot longer, but there’s no immediate, noticeable advantage to working out, even if doing so is obviously beneficial. Because of this, many people lack the motivation to bother trying.

Looking to change this is Sweat Economy, creator of the move-to-earn fitness app Sweatcoin, which is aiming to make society more active by making it profitable to move.

The idea that “movement” in itself has value may seem strange at first, but it’s actually quite logical when we consider the impacts it has on our health.

“Sweat Economy believes that your physical activity – namely, your steps – has tangible value, to yourself, your family, your doctor, your health insurer, your employer and ultimately even the country you live in,” said Oleg Fomenko Co-founder of Sweat Economy.

The point is that being active results in long-term health benefits, which means physical advantages for the individual concerned. It translates to improvements in your mood, your productivity at work and reduced absenteeism at work, Derlyatka said, ultimately benefiting society as a whole. In other words, the act of moving has value because it enables people to live longer and more productive lives, he said, and it’s this value that the Sweatcoin app is tapping into, rewarding its users with cryptocurrency tokens based on the number of daily steps they take.

“As we incentivize people to be more physically active, we increase human productivity, alleviate the burden on the social healthcare system and create a healthier planet,”

Derlyatka said. So it makes sense that movement has value because it brings tangible benefits. Sweat Economy’s mission is to transform that value into something that’s immediately beneficial, to motivate the world to create even more value by moving more.

The Sweatcoin app wasn’t always about crypto. When it first launched back in 2015, the sweatcoins that users earned as rewards for taking a minimum of 1,000 steps a day were originally just reward points that could be redeemed for lucky prize draws and discounts on certain products sold by its partners. However, crypto was the plan all along, it’s just that Sweatcoin’s founders came up with their idea a little too early, before the infrastructure was in place to bring the concept to life.

“We wanted to make the world more physically active by offering incentives,” Derlyatka related. “We were looking into forking Bitcoin in 2015, and in 2016 we met Vitalik Buterin to see if we should be creating the currency of movement on Ethereum, but he told us blockchains weren’t ready yet. So we opted to start centralized, get the user base and business model correct and then go from there.”

So Sweatcoin came into life as a Web2 fitness application, though it always intended to transition when the time was right. With the launch of Near blockchain’s mainnet in 2022, Sweatcoin finally decided that it was ready to make the leap into Web3, swapping its in-app reward points for a new cryptocurrency token, SWEAT.

The Largest Web3 Onboarding Event In History

For an application that had already amassed more than 120 million users, the decision to suddenly jump from Web2 to Web3 might be seen as a risky one. While crypto has its supporters, there are just as many – if not more – detractors, who worry that it’s a scam, has no value, is too difficult to understand, risky etc.

Realizing the need to placate these fears, Sweat Economy took multiple steps to ensure the onboarding process was as smooth as can possibly be. For one thing, there is no upfront investment required by users, Derlyatka explained. Both the original Sweatcoin app, and the new Sweat Wallet app, are free to download and use. Moreover, there is no KYC process or complicated user interface, as is often the case with most other digital wallet applications.

“We created a simple and seamless UX on Sweat Wallet to onboard our users from Sweatcoin,” Derlyatka said. “So the user simply logs in with their Sweatcoin account, the wallet is created for them without any barriers such as needing to know what a seed phrase is or how to store it safely.”

The other aspect of getting existing users onboard with Sweat Wallet and the idea of earning SWEAT tokens was to eliminate all of the crypto and Web3 jargon that’s more or less exclusive to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. So instead of “staking” your SWEAT tokens to earn interest, users have the option to “grow” their holdings. It’s a language that regular folks understand, and allows Sweat Economy to quite literally ‘walk’ people into the world of crypto, in more ways than one.

It’s a strategy that has borne fruit. Of Sweatcoin’s 120 million global user base, more than 13 million of them created a Sweat Wallet at the time of SWEAT’s token generation event in September 2022, making it the largest Web3 onboarding event in history.

“Not just the largest, but the largest by a factor of ten!” Derlyatka said.

Since then, Sweat Economy has gone from strength to strength, with organic growth of around 10,000 new Sweat Wallet sign-ups per day, with the app itself consistently ranking in DappRadar’s top 10 Blockchain Dapps since its launch in September.

Derlyatka said Sweat Wallet’s success shows that the world is ready for a low-barrier entry into Web3, and he anticipates even more rapid growth when the company launches a more aggressive marketing strategy that will encourage users to buy NFTs to enhance their SWEAT token rewards.

A Sustainable Economy Based On Movement

Sweat Economy’s second major challenge was to ensure that SWEAT is able to actually represent the value of movement. What’s to stop millions of people from earning SWEAT every day and flooding the world with SWEAT tokens and diluting its value? This is where its unique, sustainable “tokenomics” comes into play, along with several different forms of utility.

The first aspect is that SWEAT is designed to be anti-inflationary, with an ever decreasing rate of inflation. Derlyatka explained that, as more users sign up to the Sweat Wallet, it becomes progressively more difficult to earn each SWEAT coin. Already, just six months after its launch, SWEAT is now three-times more difficult to mint, he said.

In addition, Derlyatka explained that Sweat Economy’s treasury is committed to using a minimum of 50% of its profits, derived from its Web2 revenue streams, to buy SWEAT tokens from the open market. Those tokens are then either burned – removed from circulation – or distributed as “staking” rewards, based on what the democratic and decentralized Sweat Economy community decides to do with them. The result is that, even as more users join in and start earning SWEAT, the number of tokens in circulation will remain fairly constant.

SWEAT also has tons of utility that encourages users to put their rewards to use. Users are encouraged to deposit their earnings in what are known as “growth jars”, which allows them to receive an attractive return on those deposits. Essentially, it’s just like staking in other types of cryptocurrency, only in addition to the returns, users also stand the chance to win amazing prizes, including iPhones, fitness gear and a Tesla Model 3, for example. Alternatively, Sweatcoin users can just take their earnings and swap them for Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency on a third-party crypto exchange, essentially cashing out their rewards.

However, users who want to be able to influence the Sweat Economy community would do better to keep a hold of their rewards. Derlyatka said Sweat Economy’s decentralization strategy envisions a much larger role for SWEAT in future, providing governance rights to users.

“Token holders will have power with regard to key decisions around Sweat Economy, starting with token burning,” Derlyatka said. So Sweatcoin’s users themselves will have a say in ensuring that the economic model remains sustainable and continues to bring value to movement.

According to Derlyatka, Sweat Economy’s ultimate ambition is to build a global economy in which millions of people can experience the value of movement.

“When someone asks one of our users, ”what makes SWEAT valuable?”, they won’t have to launch into a list of jargon, utilities and use cases,” Derlyatka said. “They will simply be able to say, it represents the value of their physical activity.”","https://blockonomi.com/sweatcoin-incentivising-fitness/"
"Justin Sun Wants To Buy The Silk Road Stash From The US Government","TRON’s founder isn’t scared to bid for the Silk Road Bitcoin stash. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, has proposed…","TRON’s founder isn’t scared to bid for the Silk Road Bitcoin stash. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, has proposed acquiring some of the Silk Road Bitcoin from the US government “at a 10% discount for an OTC deal.”

The crypto entrepreneur announced his bid in a Twitter thread made on Friday, stating that the proposal would “minimize the potential impact on the market.”

Sun’s statement came briefly after the US confirmed selling part of Bitcoin connected to Silk Road.

The sale of 9.861 BTC was conducted on March 14 when Bitcoin surpassed the $25,000 mark. The selling price was reported at $21,800 for each BTC and transaction fees reached $215,000.

The previous report indicated that earlier in March, a number of Bitcoin were reportedly moved to Coinbase. The recent news of the confiscation of 50,000 Bitcoin from James Zhong, who was involved in the infamous Silk Road cybercrime, has caused quite a stir in the cryptocurrency world.

It is estimated that the total value of the confiscated Bitcoin amounts to a staggering $1.4 billion, making it one of the largest Bitcoin seizures in history.

However, the US government has already sold off a portion of the Bitcoin, with the remaining 8,500 BTC being sold in multiple auctions throughout 2022. The subsequent four sales, scheduled for the coming months in 2023, are expected to attract significant interest from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals.

Sun Wants The Score

Despite the looming threat of increased selling pressure on the Bitcoin market, the price of Bitcoin has continued to defy all expectations and has maintained its impressive momentum. In fact, in March 2023, Bitcoin surpassed $29,000, indicating that the demand for the world’s largest cryptocurrency is still alive and well.

Many experts in the industry believe that the continued adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation will continue to drive demand and push the price higher.

Sun previously offered to buy Credit Suisse at a $1.5 billion bid. It remains to be seen whether any official proposal was made. However, the European bank was eventually acquired by UBS Group at $3.2 billion.

Meanwhile, TRON’s founder is facing a couple of negative news. Reports suggest that Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, may have been no longer Grenada’s ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in June 2022.

Grenada media traced this development back to the Grenada elections, where the political party that had appointed Sun was defeated by its opponents, leading to the new administration recalling all ambassadors for the reallocation of duties.

Despite these reports, Sun has yet to confirm whether he is still Grenada’s ambassador.

In 2021, Sun surprised many when he announced his appointment as Grenada’s ambassador to the WTO, despite having no previous links with the country. Some have speculated that this move was an intentional ploy by Sun to gain legal immunity applicable to diplomatic staff.

Sun is Shameless

Since then, Sun has appeared in interviews and promotions with the flag of Grenada and logos of the various crypto companies he manages or acquires, including TRON (TRX), BitTorrent (BTT), Poloniex exchange, and most recently, Huobi exchange.

Sun has also actively promoted the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the TRON ecosystem in the Caribbean, claiming that the Dominican island nation recognizes TRX, BTT, JST, NFT, USDD, USDT, and TUSD as legal payment instruments.

Speculation about Sun’s position as an ambassador resurfaced after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for illegal securities offering related to two projects, TRON (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT), as well as engaging in market manipulation and dishonest promotion.

It looks like Sun is punching above his weight, and it is starting to catch up with him.","https://blockonomi.com/justin-sun-wants-to-buy-the-silk-road-stash-from-the-us-government/"
"Lost Worlds: Where Digital & Physical Worlds Meet Through NFTs","Lost worlds is working to make NFTs alluring to users while offering actual value for them, as well as for…","Lost worlds is working to make NFTs alluring to users while offering actual value for them, as well as for creators. By creating hybrid experiences in which the physical and virtual worlds intersect.

This is possible not only because of the intersection between the physical and digital worlds but also because the team is developing in such a way that the technical aspect of NFTs doesn’t become a hassle for potential users.

When Pokémon GO launched in 2016, millions of people all over the world found themselves exploring their cities hoping to catch their favorite pokemon.

The game’s success meant that it became the first app to make Augmented Reality mainstream, showing people that the technology could be part of their daily lives.

Today, Lost Worlds is looking to do the same with NFTs by making them more interactive and fun through its geoNFTs.

This new and unique expression of NFTs allows anyone to create and mint digital collectibles that can be geographically linked to a physical location which users can then explore to add the geoNFT to their collection.

With geoNFTs, anyone can create custom digital assets that can be linked to real-world locations like stores, museums, or events. This, of course, opens up a world of possibilities for creators, businesses, and collectors alike.

geoNFTs: It’s All About Location

Contents [Show]

As the name suggests, and was previously mentioned, geoNFTs are NFTs that have been linked to a geographical location.

Once Lost World users visit and explore the location, they will be able to have them minted and added to their collections. Users are then able to keep these geoNFTs in their collections or to trade them freely with other users using any secondary market they choose.

Businesses and creators can use geoNFTs to get interaction from existing and potential customers/followers. By having a drop spawn at their location, they will be able to get increased engagement, develop loyalty programs, and convert collectors into customers.

GeoNFTs

To prevent fake engagement from taking place, Lost Worlds has implemented strong anti-spoofing measures. This means that users won’t be able to fake their location by modifying GPS data, using VPNs, or other methods that have become popular with other location-based platforms in the past.

Ease of Access is Key

As the team behind Lost Worlds wants to make its platform as accessible and easy to use as possible, they have chosen to offer it through a web application. This means that users can access it directly from their browser without having to download it.

Not only does this mean immediate access but also makes it easy for users to interact with Lost Worlds through their favorite device, no matter what it is.

Following this line of thought, Lost World doesn’t require its users to use a crypto wallet to mint the NFTs as this is often one of the major challenges preventing new users from using NFT platforms.

Instead, users who are not familiar with or don’t want to deal with crypto will be able to use the Paper Wallet option, which will allow them to pay via credit card or Apple/Google Pay.

Those who opt to connect a crypto wallet will have access to some of the most popular names, including WalletConnect, MetaMask, and Coinbase. The process of collecting or creating a wallet takes less than 30 seconds, meaning that users can start using Lost Worlds without any hassle.

Bringing Interactivity to the World of NFTs

The potential for NFTs to be more interactive and engaging with the physical world is enormous but has not really been explored by blockchain developers.

Lost Worlds is at the forefront of this new frontier which is the creation of hybrid experiences by not relying on speculation to provide value. This means Lost Worlds users need to interact with the platform and creators in an intended manner, as paying is not the way to acquire geoNFTs.

Lost Worlds makes use of a system reminiscent to that of Pokémon GO’s “PokéStop”, which relies on radiuses at determined locations. Once the user is within this radius, they will immediately be eligible to mint the geoNFTs available in that drop.

You can explore the world here and find NFTs near you here.

Creators can personalize the radius of their drops, going as big as generating state, country, and global drops or as small as a business location.

To users, this means they can scroll through a list or explore a map that will show them the drops they are in the range of, as well as those closest to them.

Lost World gives users the ability to explore with the sole purpose of getting new geoNFTs, making the experience more interactive and allowing for innovative applications like exploration challenges or hunts.

Lost World has also introduced a “Quests” feature which is just what it sounds like. Creators can choose to have users meet certain conditions to earn these achievements, which will in turn reward them with prizes like geoNFTs or LOST.

Meet LOST: The Cryptocurrency Powering Lost Worlds

Lost worlds makes use of the LOST token, a deflationary cryptocurrency that will see its supply decrease over time as a percentage gets regularly burned with every transaction.

This includes transactions relying on fiat currencies, as the fees generated are used to acquire LOST tokens and have them burnt.

LOST is the soul of Lost Worlds despite users being able to use fiat. Not only will users not using fiat be required to pay for every minting using LOST but it will also be rewarded to users as parts of drops and quests.

The token ensures that interaction is always taking place and all users are incentivized to actively engage with each other (creators and collectors).

Users will also be able to stake their LOST to generate passive gains, a model popularized by Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms years ago.

However, Lost Worlds has introduced an interesting idea to this staking: for every LOST emitted as a result of staking, the same amount will be burned. This means that users can actively incentivize the burning of tokens, which in addition to the emission of LOST will result in increased gains for them.

The Road So Far and Ahead

Lost Worlds was first envisioned by Ad Executive Quaison “Kwaysin” Carter and IBM Engineer Adam Sawicki back in 2021 during the peak of the NFT hype. What originally emerged from a brainstorming session via Telegram would eventually become the main project they were working on.

Since then, they have integrated new members into the team and developed a product that is taking the world of NFTs by storm.

Lost Worlds’ beta became publicly available as part of Avalanche Summit in 2022, gaining support from over 35 brands and projects who chose to create their own geoNFTs.

The team has also successfully implemented LOST’s Initial DEX Offering, completed a private sale, got listed in exchanges like MEXC and Pangolin, and introduced important features like quests, staking, Paper Wallet, and credit card checkout.

The team is now focusing on launching LOST V2, the second version of its beta which will come with a mobile web dAPP and many of the features the team has developed so far.

Partnerships have also been a big part of the team’s efforts, which has managed to onboard important communities like Avalanche Summit, Continents, and Portals.","https://blockonomi.com/lost-worlds/"
"Crypto Crackdown: SEC Seeks More Funding, New Proposal To Ban Crypto Wallets","With the increased level of the crackdown, funding is crucial for the SEC to enforce cryptocurrencies and other financial products…","With the increased level of the crackdown, funding is crucial for the SEC to enforce cryptocurrencies and other financial products effectively.

On March 29, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler requested an additional budget of $2.4 billion, citing an increased effort to conduct investigations and bring legal actions to “misconduct.”

Part of the funding will be used to invest in “new tools, expertise, and resources” required to keep up with the fast-paced industry. Alternatively, the SEC plans to expand its enforcement team by adding 170 new members.

The SEC Wants to Grow

The agency’s Division of Enforcement is responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations of federal securities laws, including those related to cryptocurrencies.

In 2022, the agency reportedly handled “more than 35,000 separate tips, complaints, and referrals from whistleblowers and others.”

The SEC brought 750 enforcement actions upon processing these claims, with crypto-related cases accounting for 250 actions. The total value of crypto fines spiked in 2022 at $242 million, representing a 36% increase over the 22 actions announced in 2021.

The SEC’s request came after the agency alleged the Beaxy crypto exchange and its executives for conducting an unregistered securities offering. Beaxy had to shut down its operation in the U.S. following the charges.

The exchange’s founder, Artak Hamazaspyan, was also accused of illegally raising $8 million in an unregistered securities offering of the native token BXY.

The SEC claimed that Hamazaspian embezzled $900,000 in funds for personal use. The agency also brought charges against other executives, Nicholas Murphy and Randolph Bay Abbott.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has become increasingly active in bringing cryptocurrency companies and individuals to justice. Over the last few months, several claims and notices have been filed against prominent names in the industry.

Some notable cases included crypto exchanges Kraken, Genisis, the issuer of Binance USD (BUSD) Paxos, TRON’s founder Justin Sun, and most recently, top crypto exchange Coinbase.

Unstoppable Moves

On Wednesday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren reintroduced a proposal called the “Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act” to ban crypto wallets.

The proposal debuted in December 2022, focusing on increased consumer protection by prohibiting digital asset mixers and tightening non-custodial wallets.
The proposed Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act has sparked a heated debate in the crypto community.
While some argue that it is necessary to regulate the crypto industry to prevent illicit activities, others believe the proposed ban on crypto wallets is not the answer.
Critics of the bill argue that it is misguided and that banning crypto wallets would be ineffective in preventing money laundering and harm legitimate users who rely on non-custodial wallets for privacy and security reasons.
In response to the criticism, Senator Elizabeth Warren defended her proposal, stating that closing the loopholes that allow criminals to use crypto to launder money and finance illegal activities is necessary.
She argues that by banning crypto wallets, the government can prevent bad actors from hiding their identities and tracing the flow of funds, making it easier to catch criminals.
The proposed bill has also received criticism from industry leaders and organizations, including the Blockchain Association, who argue that it is too broad and could stifle innovation in the crypto industry.
They suggest that instead of a ban, the government should focus on implementing effective regulation that balances consumer protection with innovation.

No entity can escape the power of the laws. Proper regulations are required to protect the crypto users. At the same time, regulators are called to embrace the natural law of evolution. The unstoppable effort to crack down on the industry is a double-edged sword; it could kill innovation.

Clearly, the moves in the U.S. are anti-crypto, but they are not global in scope.","https://blockonomi.com/crypto-crackdown-sec-seeks-more-funding-new-proposal-to-ban-crypto-wallets/"
"China & France Complete First LNG Gas Trade Using Chinese CBDC","The US dollar has dominated the energy trades for decades. But a shift in the currency hierarchy is coming. China…","The US dollar has dominated the energy trades for decades. But a shift in the currency hierarchy is coming.

China and France settled their first LNG gas trade using the Chinese CBDC – the digital yuan, Reuters disclosed on March 29.

Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange, China’s energy trading exchange, reportedly facilitated the Yuan-based transactions, which encompassed 65,000 tonnes of LNG “ imported from the UAE.”

The Era of CBDCs is Here

Contents [Show]

The development of the digital yuan has been ongoing since 2014 and accelerated steadily in recent years.

People’s Bank of China has conducted a pilot program for its digital yuan in several provinces and cities across the country. Alternatively, the central bank has been reportedly working with major banks and payment providers to integrate the CBDC into their systems.

It’s noteworthy that China’s CBDC project is still in the pilot phase with no official launch date. With the first Yun-based gas trade, China achieved initial success in using the CBDC for international trade.

And no doubt the landmark event indicates that the country’s reliance on the US dollar is reduced.

China is undoubtedly leading the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) race. The development of the CBDC strengthens its position as a global economic power. At the same time, people start questioning the fate of the US dollar.

Will it be the beginning of the end for the American dollar’s dominance?

The Last Days of USD?

The US dollar is under unrelenting pressure due to the recent banking crisis, rather than external forces.

Tracing back to March 13, the US dollar fell sharply after authorities’ intervention to stop the spreading contagion caused by the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.

The situation was seemingly under control but still, the dollar holds its breath. President Biden said today that the bank crisis is “not over yet.”

Further explosions might not be a favorable situation for the dollar. But rumors have it that the banking turbulence could pave the way for the case of CBDCs.

The United States, while potentially trailing behind other countries in the development of a digital currency, will certainly not be absent from the surge of interest in CBDC.

Some authorities have indicated that the development of a digital dollar could significantly enhance the payments infrastructure in the country, as well as play a crucial role in the future of finance.

Opportunity For Crypto?

The good thing about fiat transactions is the ability to hold privacy and anonymity. It is a basic right of any individual. But the debt-based fiat monetary system is too vulnerable. The transition to digital payment is imminent.

But CBDC is not the only option since cryptocurrencies secured a seat at the table. The demand for CBDC remains low. Both China and Nigeria have tested the use of their CBDCs but the initial results failed to meet expectations.

Some investors remain cautious about the use of CBDCs, especially given the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks and data breaches in recent years.

There are concerns that CBDCs could potentially be weaponized against them, leading to possible reversal or even threats to their security. Consequently, not all investors are willing to fully embrace the use of CBDCs.

The craze for central bank digital currencies has increased significantly in recent months. Several countries like China have launched their CBDCs. The pilot phase of the digital yuan has been successfully rolled out in several cities across China, and the country has been actively working to integrate the digital yuan into its financial system.

Despite China’s anti-crypto stance, investors are still drawn to the market. At the end of the day, investors have their own choice of currency.

While governments can regulate and restrict the use of certain currencies, people will always find ways to access the market if they believe that there is value to be found.","https://blockonomi.com/china-france-complete-first-lng-gas-trade-using-chinese-cbdc/"

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.

How Suitable is 3Commas for beginners?

The platform is generally quite easy to navigate, even for new traders, and the trading bots are easy to set up. Various features are easy to access from inside your account, and connecting to an exchange, and setting up smart trades and bots can be done at the click of a button. The Dashboard is also well laid out, and the side panel allows users to quickly select their preferred tabs and features.

In addition, features such as bot analytics which details the best performing bots and trade pairs, and the marketplace are well executed and simple to understand. While the portfolio creation, tracking, and social trading features suit both new and more experienced traders.

You can search through and analyze a variety of portfolios from inside your account while also monitoring their performance and keeping an eye on them by following any portfolios of interest. You can also copy a portfolio if desired; although you will need to have the same exchanges linked in order to fully utilize this feature.

The trader’s diary is another feature that benefits traders of various levels as it provides a concise report of all the trades made on your linked exchanges, and allows you to easily identify any profits or losses incurred on a particular trade within a set period of time.

This helps you to gauge the performance of your trading bots, and works in tandem with the ability to set up a range of notifications whether in browser, for mobile, or by email and notifications can be configured from the Settings tab in your account.

Another major plus is the wealth of resources made available on the platform, and the Support Section contains a number of guides, and FAQs that help people get to grips with the most important issues.

Furthermore, the team maintain a blog that details a number of key concepts for newer traders, and also provide further assistance via their Telegram group, YouTube Channel, and other social media channels, and members can gain access to the 3Commas Discord from inside their accounts.

"Blockchain Security Firm Verichains Identifies Critical Key Recovery Attacks","Verichains, a leading provider of blockchain security solutions, has announced that the firm discovered critical Key Recovery Attacks in Popular…","Verichains, a leading provider of blockchain security solutions, has announced that the firm discovered critical Key Recovery Attacks in Popular Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), a Multi-Party Computing (MPC) protocol.

MPC is one of the most popular technologies used by multiparty wallets and digital asset custody solutions. With these vulnerabilities, many of the current safety protocols will be impacted.

It has quickly become the standard for securing digital assets of many major blockchain and financial organizations, such as the largest global custodian bank BNY Mellon, Europe’s largest neobank Revolut, ING, Binance, Fireblocks, and Coinbase.

Popular Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) Are Vulnerable to Key Recovery Attacks

Although blockchain technology is increasingly developed and adopted, ensuring the security and availability of funds without relying on a single trusted entity is one of the challenges needed to solve.

A Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a cryptographic protocol allowing a group of parties to generate a signature on a message without revealing their secret keys.

As a result, the funds can be controlled by a set of signers who can cooperate to authorize transactions. Many organizations today are implementing MPC protocols for threshold ECDSA based on GG18, GG20, and CGGMP21 algorithms.

Founded in 2017, the blockchain security company focuses on blockchain solutions including perimeter security, code audits, cryptanalysis, and incident investigation.

The firm is also known that helped investigate and fix security issues in crypto hacks, the Ronin Bridge and BNB Bridge are examples.

Verichains has started researching threshold ECDSA security in Oct 2022.

The blockchain security firm has also found that although having undergone multiple audits by leading security firms, most TSS implementations, including popular open-source libraries, are still vulnerable to key recovery attacks.

To do that, working proof of concept attacks that demonstrate a full private key extraction have been built by a single malicious party in 1-2 signing ceremonies on various popular wallets, non-custodial key infrastructure, and cross-chain asset management protocols.

“Verichains has a strong commitment to responsible vulnerability disclosure, and we take careful and considered steps when disclosing attacks, especially given the wide range of impacted projects and significant user funds at risk,” the Co-Founder of Verichains and former CPU Security Lead at Intel Thanh Nguyen said.

While having left a notice to the affected organizations, the firm will also release details of the attacks when the vulnerabilities have been solved.

The Importance of Blockchain Security

Today, while internet technologies are constantly developing, blockchain technologies create new business forms that allow decentralized digital transformation.

Getting up to speed with blockchain developments requires in-depth knowledge of a wide range of development, scripting languages, and other resources.

Although being one of the most innovative and disruptive technologies used today, blockchain technology is still new to the cybersecurity industry.

With the widespread use of this technology, there are still not enough developers that are experienced with blockchain and well-versed in cryptography.

On the other hand, designed by a large-scale architecture with many layers, such as consensus, smart contracts, or networks, blockchains are also often targeted in cyber-attacks and expose a wide variety of vulnerabilities.

Hence, it is necessary in implementing a cybersecurity assessment process for blockchain solutions to address related cybersecurity threats, and mitigate risks, as well as, provide continuous monitoring of new threats and incidents.

Verichains has reported that not only systems based on ECDSA can be vulnerable but at least $8 billion of total locked value is also going to be impacted.

The firm is calling blockchain projects and platforms relying on threshold ECDSA to prioritize implementing robust security measures and seeking review from security experts to ensure their platforms’ safety and security.","https://blockonomi.com/blockchain-security-firm-verichains-identifies-critical-key-recovery-attacks/"
"CZ: Binance Always Acts In Compliance With Local Laws","On Tuesday, the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that it filed a lawsuit against the largest crypto exchange,…","On Tuesday, the U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that it filed a lawsuit against the largest crypto exchange, claiming that it did not take the necessary measures to verify the customer’s true identity and profited from this action.

A response was delivered in less than 24 hours. CZ made a brief statement on Binance’s official website to deny the latest charges. The CEO of Binance emphasized two points – first, Binance’s compliance with regulations, and second, the exchange’s trading rules.

Binance always acts in compliance with American and global regulations, according to the statement.

The firm previously established its own Compliance teams with extensive law backgrounds in an effort to cope with law enforcement requests. Binance reportedly seized accounts that failed to follow the ruling.

The seized amounts were estimated at $125 million in 2022 and $160 million in 2023.

Tough Times for Binance

Contents [Show]

Binance’s all-encompassing technology serves a vital role in ensuring full compliance. Accordingly, Binance.com is highly restricted to U.S. users.

Binance said it could achieve that using, “nationality (KYC), IP (including commonly used VPN endpoints outside of the US), mobile carrier, device fingerprints, bank deposit and withdrawals, blockchain deposits and withdrawals, credit card bin numbers, and more.”

The company asserted that it would continue to meet compliance obligations in the U.S. and other countries.

Since the CFTC alleged Binance of conducting insider trading under 300 accounts, this allegation caused some frustrations among crypto investors, especially Binance’s users.

Insider trading undermines the market’s integrity and can damage the reputation of the exchanges and individuals involved.

Regarding this matter, CZ stated that Binance.com does not participate in profit-driven trading or market manipulation.

The platform reportedly affiliated entities providing liquidity for fewer liquid pairs, but claims these affiliates are closely monitored. CZ also indicated the exchange’s 90-day no-day-trading rule, which prohibits employees from selling a coin “within 90 days of your most recent buy, or vice versa.”

A Downhill Slide

Since the end of last year, negative news about Binance has become uglier than just personal attacks. In December 2022, Reuters reported that the US watchdogs had investigated Binance since 2018 for suspected money laundering and sanctions violations.

The recent lawsuit filed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against Binance has caused shockwaves in the crypto community. In response to the lawsuit, Binance has expressed disappointment and surprise, claiming that the move was “unexpected.”

Binance faces the possibility of heavy fines, as the CFTC has asked the court to impose fines, demand the return of illicit profits, and permanently ban registration and trading.

Crypto Firms Face Uncertain Regulatory Landscape

The regulatory crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry shows no signs of slowing down. The latest move was spearheaded by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Speaking with CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday, CFTC Chief Rostin Behnam insisted on the need for aggressive moves due to the ongoing fraud. It’s clear that the regulatory scrutiny on crypto has intensified sharply over a couple of months.

The crypto industry currently faces challenges regarding security and trust from investors. The high-profile hacks and a series of collapses have eroded confidence in the market, making it even more difficult for companies to gain a foothold in the industry.

While the U.S. watchdogs are making efforts to crack down on fraud and misconduct in the crypto industry, the lack of clear regulations and guidelines makes it difficult for companies to operate and thrive in the U.S.

The situation led companies to explore alternative markets and jurisdictions that offer more favorable regulations for cryptocurrency businesses. While the U.S. is a large market at the moment for crypto, that may change.","https://blockonomi.com/cz-binance-always-acts-in-compliance-with-local-laws/"
"MicroStrategy Buys More Bitcoin As Binance Comes Under Fire","The crypto market is declining following MicroStrategy’s news. But there may be more at play than just this single event.…","The crypto market is declining following MicroStrategy’s news. But there may be more at play than just this single event.

MicroStrategy’s co-founder Michael Saylor announced on Monday that the company just purchased 6,455 bitcoin, equivalent to around $179 million at the press time.

The investment totals 138,955 ($4.14 billion) in the company’s bitcoin holding.

In addition, MicroStrategy reportedly repaid a $205 million loan to Silvergate Bank. The crypto-friendly bank discontinued earlier this month after a titanic financial struggle.

Silvergate Bank and MicroStrategy reportedly entered a loan agreement for the purpose of bitcoin acquisition.

The software company has borrowed money from many institutions to enrich its bitcoin holding as part of its strategy to hold bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

However, the executive highlighted that instead of repaying the original amount, the company only needed to pay off the loan at a 22% discount, approximately $160 million.

“MicroStrategy repaid its $205M Silvergate loan at a 22% discount. As of 3/23/23, $MSTR acquired an additional 6,455 bitcoins for $150M at an average of $23,238 per bitcoin and held 138,955 BTC acquired for $4.14B at an average of $29,817 per bitcoin,” Michael Saylor said in the announcement.

A Losing Bet So Far

According to estimates, MicroStrategy suffered a 45% loss by the end of 2022, resulting from a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s price. The recent rally in the market has closed the gap in MicroStrategy’s portfolio.

MicroStrategy has no plan to stop stacking, regardless of the volatile price movements of the flagship crypto. MicroStrategy sees its bitcoin holdings as a long-term investment rather than a short-term speculation.

The company has stated that it plans to hold its bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset for the foreseeable future. It encouraged other entities to consider adding bitcoin to their balance sheets.

As of March 27, 2023, Michael Saylor and his company are two of the entities that own the most Bitcoin.

Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous individual believed to be the creator of Bitcoin, and Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, are some of the well-known whales.

Crypto Market Down

Saylor’s move to purchase Bitcoin has been historically associated with the price movement.

The price of Bitcoin mostly went down whenever similar news broke out in the past. Bitcoin is trading at around $26,800 following the decision, a 3.21% decline in the last 24 hours.

However, the recent decline could result from other news, specifically the latest news regarding the lawsuit against Binance by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

On the day of MicroStrategy’s additional bitcoin purchase, the CFTC brought a lawsuit against Binance Holdings and Changpeng Zhao, the firm’s CEO, claiming that the entities violated trading and derivatives rules.

In the filing, the CFTC included multiple internal messages from Binance in the lawsuit, which acknowledge that the exchange has processed transactions for terrorists.

In addition to the accusations of processing transactions for terrorists, the regulators also accused Binance of operating its own trading unit of 300 accounts.

The CFTC wants the court to impose administrative sanctions on Binance, a permanent ban on trading and account registration, and other penalties if found to be repeat offenders.

The CFTC has reportedly been investigating Binance since late 2021. The agency has been cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges that operate in the United States without proper regulatory oversight.

In the lawsuit, the CFTC continues strengthening its position that Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and two stablecoins, USDT and BUSD, are commodities.

On the other hand, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly asserted that most cryptocurrencies are securities, except for Bitcoin.

The lawsuit has caused a stir in the industry, with most cryptocurrencies have been down. Given the stance by regulators globally, the recent CFTC action could be a sign of things to come.","https://blockonomi.com/microstrategy-buys-more-bitcoin-as-binance-comes-under-fire/"
"Nasdaq To Launch Crypto Custody Services Later This Year","Nasdaq plans to capitalize on the growing demand for crypto-related services and help drive further innovation in the space. The…","Nasdaq plans to capitalize on the growing demand for crypto-related services and help drive further innovation in the space. The news came amid endless turbulence and increased regulatory pressure.

Nasdaq’s crypto custody services are already underway, according to Bloomberg’s report on March 24. The launch is expected to occur by the end of June this year.

In September 2022, Nasdaq announced the establishment of Nasdaq Digital Assets, a division dedicated to offering crypto custody services.

The move carried a competitive message, especially since other financial giants such as Fidelity Investments, BNY Mellon, and BlackRock tipped their toes into the crypto space.

A Big Move Into Crypto Custody

Contents [Show]

Speaking with Bloomberg, Ira Auerbach, Senior Vice President and Head of Nasdaq Digital Assets, said that the New York-based stock exchange has been developing an advanced custody solution for digital assets.

At the same time, Nasdaq has applied to provide digital asset custody services. The services are currently awaiting approval from the New York Department of Financial Services.

Initially, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) custody will be the key focuses. The exchange also targets to provide crypto services to financial institutions.

Adena Friedman, President and CEO of Nasdaq, previously stated that the exchange aims to provide several advanced solutions such as market technology, and crypto-related indexes for tradable products, or crypto-related financial crime, to serve the crypto ecosystem.

Nasdaq is well-established and popular with stock traders. The giant oversees multiple US and global equity markets, and now it is taking a huge bet on the cryptocurrency.

However, the move gives no sense of surprise as in fact the exchange partnered with some crypto exchanges including Gemini to provide them with market surveillance technology.

The technology enables these exchanges to monitor activities on their platforms and detect any fraudulent or manipulative practices, improving their overall security measures.

More Popular All The Time

Additionally, in February 2021, Nasdaq launched the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF in collaboration with Brazilian asset manager Hashdex.

Given all the records, Nasdaq has taken a cautious approach to the nascent industry. Instead of making waves, the exchange preferred to be the technology provider.

Providing technology to crypto exchanges allowed Nasdaq to capitalize on the growing demand for crypto-related services without having to assume the risks associated with trading or mining cryptocurrencies.

This strategy allowed the company to diversify its revenue streams and expand its customer base, minimizing its exposure to market volatility while waiting for the right time to engage itself in the space.

Wall Street Took Notice

Serious efforts have flooded into the market. No doubt Wall Street players have taken notice and are making steady moves toward the sector. This race is driven by the surging demand for exposure to the cryptocurrency market.

Institutions often adopt custodial services to store private keys or hold funds on exchanges to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, and this has created an opportunity for companies like Nasdaq to offer crypto-related services.

In addition to Nasdaq, other major players in traditional finance, such as BlackRock, Mastercard, and BNY Mellon, have also entered the crypto space. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, partnered with Coinbase and launched a Bitcoin trust fund in 2020 to give high-income clients access to cryptocurrencies.

Despite the bleak market outlook and regulatory uncertainty, these companies are recognizing the significant demand for crypto-related services and are taking action to meet that demand.

While the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, the growing interest in the sector is simply too big to ignore.

Major players in traditional finance are planting their seeds even in the face of tightening regulatory scrutiny. These moves are likely to drive further innovations in the crypto space and encourage more institutional investors to enter the market.","https://blockonomi.com/nasdaq-to-launch-crypto-custody-services-later-this-year/"
"Terra Labs’ Founder Do Kwon Under Arrest In Montenegro","Do Kwon, the notorious name behind Terra’s collapse, was reportedly under arrest by Montenegro’s watchdogs at Podgorica Airport on March…","Do Kwon, the notorious name behind Terra’s collapse, was reportedly under arrest by Montenegro’s watchdogs at Podgorica Airport on March 23. The news broke out amid the Arbitrum listing taking the community by storm.

A Twitter account believed to be Filip Adzic’s, minister of the interior of Montenegro, said that Montenegro’s watchdogs arrested one of the most wanted, Do Kwon – co-founder of Terraform Labs.

Local news outlet Vijesti later confirmed that it was the official account of the minister.

To wit,

“Montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder, and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs.”

Busted in Montenegro

The South Korean police have confirmed to the Yonhap news agency that the person under arrest in Montenegro’s capital’s airport was Do Kwon, the founder of TerraForm Labs. He was arrested with fake documents.

Investors worldwide have been searching for Do Kwon’s whereabouts since the Terra-LUNA disaster.

Earlier reports suggested that he may be hiding in Serbia or Dubai, but South Korean prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for him last year and enlisted Interpol’s help to locate and arrest him.

In February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs over a $60 billion securities fraud involving LUNA and the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin.

The collapse of one of the largest crypto empires run by Do Kwon in May 2022 due to the unstable UST and LUNA tokens caused billions of dollars in losses for investors worldwide, contributing to the collapse of the Three Arrows Capital (3AC) fund and causing asset liquidation.

The event also eroded investor confidence, indirectly bringing down many cryptocurrency exchanges and other industry platforms.

Despite South Korean authorities announcing that Do Kwon is wanted for violating capital market laws since mid-September 2022, his exact whereabouts have remained unknown, even after an Interpol red notice.

Meanwhile, Do Kwon has denied any wrongdoing, and Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra, has argued that existing market laws do not apply to cryptocurrencies.

In addition, the US authorities are reportedly investigating Do Kwon’s relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX exchange and Alameda Research which also collapsed last year.

Will He Spill The Beans?

In the wake of Kwon’s arrest, the price of Terra (LUNA) has taken a hit, dropping by 8%. Surprisingly, the price of Terra Classic (LUNC), which is a rebranding of the original LUNA, has also plummeted by 4%.

It is worth noting that LUNA and LUNC are different entities, with LUNA being a hard fork that has separated from Do Kwon. The collapse of Terra serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of fraudulent activity in the cryptocurrency world.

The demise has raised the issue of tighter regulations for stablecoins to protect investors. It has also made crypto investors wary of decentralized finance that includes token trading, borrowing, and lending operations, like the model Kwon built.

In the US, stablecoins with algorithms like TerraUSD have been banned for two years, and in South Korea, interest in cryptocurrencies has dwindled.

The situation surrounding Do Kwon and Terra has drawn the attention of regulatory bodies and the broader cryptocurrency community, highlighting the ongoing challenges of regulating a rapidly evolving and complex industry.

As cryptocurrency continues to gain popularity and attract more investors, regulators are facing mounting pressure to develop clear and consistent frameworks for oversight and enforcement.

However, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, coupled with its global reach and complex technical infrastructure, poses significant challenges for regulators seeking to effectively monitor and regulate the industry.

Moreover, the question of whether or not existing laws and regulations apply to cryptocurrencies remains a contentious issue, with different jurisdictions taking varying approaches to regulation.","https://blockonomi.com/terra-labs-founder-do-kwon-under-arrest-in-montenegro/"

What is WunderTrading?

Contents [Show]

WunderTrading has grown exponentially since its launch as a cryptocurrency exchange service in Estonia. The platform has provided users with an improved trading process since its establishment in 2018.

The platform self-identifies on its website as a “financial technology firm that attempts to facilitate the real-world application of cryptocurrencies through a variety of goods and solutions.”

Traders can purchase over 100+ cryptocurrencies via credit/debit card and wire transfers on the WunderTrading platform. Some top cryptocurrencies available on the platform includes BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, XRP, etc.

In addition, the platform offers top cryptocurrency exchange features to its users. These services include an advanced trading terminal, signal marketplace, crypto portfolio tracker, and fast deposit methods.

To improve the trading experience for both basic and advanced traders, WunderTrading incorporates two major features: Automated Copy Trading and Automated Crypto Trading Bot.

The ‘Automated Copy Trading’ feature: This is designed to meet the needs of investors without prior experience trading the crypto market. The feature allows inexperienced traders to copy the moves of elite traders with a successful track record. That way, they can earn when the traders profit.
The ‘Automated Crypto Trading Bot: This feature completes trades automatically for investors. This functionality works based on trading parameters set by users. With the Automated Crypto Trading Bot integration, WunderTrading can help investors execute trades on the go and leverage market opportunities.

However, during the course of researching for this WunderTrading review, we could not verify this claim. We also discovered a few negative reviews about the functionality of the trading bot on third-party review sites.

Users can get started on this platform for free and complete verifications to access all supported features and services.

How Does WunderTrading Work?

WunderTrading has an intuitive interface and simple functionalities, so investors and traders can navigate the platform in a few clicks. The platform works like most companies operating in the crypto market. They run an identity verification before users start trading.

WunderTrading verifies all users as a basic law requirement to regulate money laundering and prevent financial crime on the crypto automation platform. Traders can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other supported cryptocurrencies via credit/debit card or wire transfer after verification.

However, WunderTrading charges trading fees on every purchase of cryptocurrency. However, these fees are low and range between the average fees in the industry.

The platform offers users four types of trading accounts which vary based on selected subscriptions or pricing.

The four types of accounts are:

Free
Basic
Pro
Premium

These subscriptions are a primary source of revenue and profit for WunderTrading.

Investors can start with the ‘Free’ account to get used to the platform before upgrading to other account tiers.

The automated trading software incorporates a powerful mobile app version of its platform to accommodate investors and traders who prefer the convenience that mobile apps bring.

Our research found that most of the app users are satisfied, according to reviews. However, a few complaints were similar to those discovered on third-party review sites. These complaints were mostly related to bugged interface and the on-screen keyboard issues.

WunderTrading Key Features

WunderTrading offers innovative features to its customers. Some of them are;

Automated Crypto Trading Bot

The automated crypto trading bots allow users to create, test and apply trade strategies to a set cryptocurrency pair within a time frame.

Once the trading bot is set up, traders can create alerts to receive signals on when to buy or sell a particular asset. The platform’s trading bots convert and execute them as soon as the signal is received.

One of the benefits of using WunderTrading bots is its capability to protect traders against volatility and grow their portfolios seamlessly. However, users should note that these crypto trading bots need to be activated by users as they only act on set parameters and specifications on a specified cryptocurrency.

Automated Copy Trading

With the WunderTrading Copy Trading tool, investors can directly copy successful traders’ strategies and incorporate them into their automated trading bots.

Users can copy the trade with the same settings in real-time as soon as the signal provider generates a signal manually or through a trading crypto bot. This tool is appealing and beneficial for crypto beginners keen on high-profit returns but doesn’t have the time or knowledge to time the market movement appropriately.

Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker

WunderTrading offers a crypto portfolio tracker to give investors a clear view of their portfolios.

The portfolio tracker lets traders keep a tab on their purchases, returns and sales. WunderTrading allows traders to manually input their trades or connect their exchange’s API to manage their portfolios easily.

Multiple Account Management

Modern traders tend to have multiple crypto accounts for different reasons. WunderTrading allows users to control trades across several exchanges from one device using the Multiple Account Management feature.

Investors can also engage in arbitrage trading. Users can simultaneously purchase and sell the same crypto assets on different markets to generate profit from tiny market movements in price. The platform supports many of the popular cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, OKX, FTX and Kraken.

Top Services on WunderTrading

WunderTrading offers exceptional services important to investors and traders keen to profit from the crypto market. These services are broken into three:

WunderTrading Cryptocurrency Exchange service provides users full access to the cryptocurrency market. Investors can use fiat currencies to purchase 100+ cryptos, including big movers like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, with credit/debit cards (Mastercard or Visa). The platform offers low trading fees and a fast payment method (credit card).
WunderTrading Commerce Services allows merchants, investors, and traders to conveniently accept cryptocurrency payments through their email or website.
WunderTrading Trade Services also offers investors a vast range of stellar trading services to simplify their trading processes and increase their profits. These trading services range from automated trading bots, copy trading tools, crypto portfolio trackers, advanced trading terminals, and many more.

Additionally, users can earn more income through the platform’s referral program. WunderTrading referrals are an income source for traders who are rewarded with a commission for every referral.

Investors can invite their friends and family to the platform and gain a 20% lifetime commission for every referred member that uses a subscription plan. Referred members also get a bonus discount of 10% on any one-month subscription plan.

Overall, the features offered by WunderTrading make it more valuable to traders than the average cryptocurrency exchange.

Can you Trade on WunderTrading?

The WunderTrading platform allows users to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. To start, crypto traders must create an account and complete the verification before accessing this platform’s full trading features and services.

Trading accounts without a completed verification can only purchase $300 worth of cryptocurrencies.

Once account verification is complete, users can buy cryptocurrencies right away through their credit cards.

In terms of selling crypto assets, the features of automated trading bots and copy trading tools have simplified the process. The complexities connected to the cryptocurrency market do not apply to WunderTrading platform users, as trading features make it easy to buy and execute trades at all times.

WunderTrading Minimum Deposit

In our analysis of WunderTrading, we learned that users can start investing in cryptocurrencies with a €50 minimum investment. Users can seamlessly initiate a deposit via credit card and bank transfer

Fees

While registering an account is free, users must subscribe to a paid plan to upgrade from the basic tier to other premium plans. Other fees that are tied to this platform include commissions and a withdrawal fee.

The membership costs range from $0 for a free account to $44.95 for a premium account. Investors can initially sign up for a free account and upgrade when they want to deploy more bots or other premium capabilities.

When users buy crypto using the platform, a commission is taken from the purchase price. The current commission is $5 or 5% of the paid invoice. Withdrawals are also subject to a charge. For instance, the Bitcoin withdrawal fee is 0.0005 BTC, around the average industry standard.

Users can fund their accounts on WunderTrading with a multitude of payment options. This includes SEPA, bank transfer, Apple Pay, debit cards and crypto payments. Each payment option comes with its separate deposit fees.

WunderTrading Pricing Plans

WunderTrading features four subscription packages for crypto traders: Free, Basic, Pro, and Premium. The platform offers subscription discounts for customers who order for more than a month.

Is WunderTrading a Scam?

Although we were unable to verify whether the WunderTrading cryptocurrency platform is a fraud, this is what we do know.

The app claims to offer a reliable way for crypto to start trading and investing in cryptocurrency easily while combining many features like a crypto exchange, a social trading platform, Bitcoin payments, and OTC services into one software.

However, despite these multiple features, WunderTrading is easy to use and best known for providing trading scripts, bots and its copy trading feature that allows traders to copy the trades of others automatically. Investors have access to four plans: free, basic, pro, and premium, with fees ranging from $0 to $49.95.

WunderTrading supports multiple payment options, including Visa, Mastercard, Skrill, Bank Transfer (SEPA), and Bitcoin. Users can manually manage multiple crypto exchanges through the trading terminal or bots.

The Estonian government regulates the platform to operate as a provider of exchange services between digital and fiat currencies. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is also used to strengthen account security.

However, while the exchange offers these features there are some concerns about an unreliable system and customer service. Users have made complaints about bots automatically closing and slowly getting slow to no response when they ask for a refund.

How to Use WunderTrading

Prospective users can begin to use WunderTrading using the simple steps explained below:

However, the free plan is good enough for anyone just starting on the platform and has enough features to help familiarise them before moving to other plans.

WunderTrading Pros and Cons

WunderTrading offers huge benefits to crypto traders and investors. However, there are areas upon which the exchange can improve.

Pros
Low trading fees
Supports top cryptos (BTC and ETH)
Automated crypto trading bot
Automated copy trading
Free account plan
Advanced trading terminal
Multiple account management

Limited payment options

Types of Trades


Zignaly supports both basic and advanced trading actions. Basic features include things like take profit, trailing stop, and stop loss. Advanced options offered include minimum volume filters, price deviations, and DCA (ReBuy Strategy).

The ability to use a trailing stop loss feature is particularly important since most exchanges do not offer this option despite it being among the most used strategies for closing in crypto trading. With a trailing stop loss, you follow the price of the crypto until a market reversal.

Supported Cryptocurrencies


To give clients the most out of the platform, Zignaly does not limit the coins that you can trade with the platform. Instead, it always accepts all pairs from the enabled signal provider that you choose. This lets you maximize the benefits of your chosen signal provider.

How Do You Trade With Zignaly?

Zignaly supports your TradingView account and the ability to use those indicators. The platform includes a TradingView Bot that lets you send your own signals right from TradingView with the Cryptocurrency Signal Finder recommendations or indicators.

Or you can use the trading terminal from Zignaly. The trading terminal lets you manually open positions with your entire strategy. You must create a strategy instead of directly setting the take profit, trailing stop, and stop loss all together on the exchange.

With the Zignaly trading terminal, you can set up your full strategy without any limitations. The terminal includes high-end features such as the ability to split your profit targets, check results for each position, trailing stop orders that combine, and concurrent order types that are different yet on the same balance.

Ease of Use


The team behind Zignaly specifically designed it to be easy to use, making that a priority from the time of launch. Those getting used to the platform can begin with some simple configurations within the general settings.

You only have to use as many settings as you want as many of them are optional. To further increase the platform’s ease-of-use, Zignaly includes explanations for every feature on each tool, so you fully understand each feature. Overall, you should be able to start using Zignaly in just 10 minutes or less.

What Else Should You Know About Trading With Zignaly?

All you have to do to use Zignaly is connect it with the signal providers of your choice and let it trade automatically, so you can make money even while you sleep. You can use auto-mode by accepting Sell signals. Or you can set up your own set of rules to close your positions and let it run.

You can also use Zignaly as a bot for TradingView with your own sell and buy signals that you send to Zignaly.

You can accept multi-targets from signals, and there are DCA-based rebuy strategy options. You can opt for sell signals to automate the close, trade with TradingView signals, and use trailing stop losses.

Zignaly Pricing


Zignaly is indeed affordable, offering a much cheaper price than most competitors. The current price is just $12 a month, which is less than half of the closest competitors. This offers great value for money and gives you more room to grow a profit with your cryptocurrency trading.

To help you ensure that you like Zignaly before making a commitment, you can take advantage of the free 30-day trial, which does not require a credit card, so you know you will not be charged.

Zignaly is a service that is fully online, and it is cloud-based. Because it runs on the cloud, you get a long list of benefits, including no need to deal with servers yourself, no installation, and the fact that the platform is always updated.

Is Zignaly Safe?

Since Zignaly involves your money, the company takes numerous steps to ensure the security of your funds at all times. Zignaly always trades directly with the exchange side. This means that your coins are always on the exchange, so you do not need to worry about withdrawal rights.

You get extra security from the fact that Zignaly does not store any funds for you, so you do not have to deposit anything. The balances remain with the exchange of your choice, so you would ask them for a withdrawal, and they control your funds.

Conclusion

Zignaly is a cryptocurrency trading bot and a proprietary trading terminal that gives users the ability to easily trade cryptocurrencies using automated strategies. You can use Zignaly with TradingView accounts, take advantage of a growing list of signal providers, and utilize a range of order types.

Since your funds remain on your chosen cryptocurrency exchange, the security concerns associated with using Zignaly are minimal. Even so, the platform has strong security measures in place.

"How to Make Money with Bitcoin: 10 Ways to Earn Cryptocurrency","There are a number of ways that individuals can earn Bitcoin online. Unfortunately, just as in real life, there is…","There are a number of ways that individuals can earn Bitcoin online. Unfortunately, just as in real life, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Any way of earning Bitcoin online will require something in exchange, whether it’s your time or your knowledge or your computer’s processing power.

Some of the methods outlined below will involve minimal effort but will also result in minimal returns. Other means of earning Bitcoin online may be more lucrative but they will require you to have a certain level of knowledge and expertise about the industry and the market.

Therefore, although it may appear to some that Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, is an easy way to make money, it is not as easy as some might expect without the requisite knowledge (a principle that can unsurprisingly be applied to any industry).

However, should you be interested in earning Bitcoin online it may be worth considering some of the below options, ranging from the least difficult (and least paid!) to the more substantial roles available in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Coinbase Earn

Contents [Show]

Probably the easiest way right now to earn some free cryptocurrency is to take advantage of Coinbase Earn. As you will probably know, Coinbase is one of the largest and easiest ways to purchase Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.

Last year they launched a new initiative called Coinbase Earn, this is a program where you can earn a variety of different cryptos by watching some educational videos about each crypto and then answering some multiple choice questions.

The coins on offer change, so it’s best to register and participate in any that are available and keep an eye out for their emails as they add new ones from time to time.

This is an easy way to earn a couple of hundred dollars of cryptocurrency which you can then withdraw or sell for fiat on the platform.

Bitcoin Lending

There are potentially significant earnings to be made in Bitcoin lending, but there is also significant risk. Bitcoin lending tends to operate through intermediary websites such as Blockfi and Nexo and the concept is as simple as it sounds.

Read our full review of BlockFi here.

BlockFi: Cryptoloans

You act as a bank, lending your Bitcoin to another person at a certain level of interest. Because the market is unregulated the levels of interest are generally much higher than the standard bank rate meaning that there is a potential for high returns.

However, on the flip-side, the unregulated nature of the transaction means that in the event that the borrower does not pay back the Bitcoin to you, there is little recourse available for you to enforce the loan.

The volatility and the risk associated with the Bitcoin lending market means that it is probably a market only accessible to very large holders of Bitcoin, due to the level of risk and the potential expense in enforcing a loan if something goes wrong. However, if handled correctly, there is huge potential market in this sector.

Although micro-earnings is the easiest method in which to earn Bitcoin, it is also probably the most time consuming of all the methods discussed, especially when taking into consideration the amount of money to be made.

Micro earning websites pay you in Bitcoin for completing small tasks. In return you can get a (very) small amount of Bitcoin. The most popular forms of micro earnings are as follows:

Paid-to-Click Websites

As suggested by the name, these websites pay users in Bitcoin for visiting certain websites or viewing certain advertisements. There are many PTC websites that will pay negligible amounts in Bitcoin for clicks and views, with Ads4BTC probably being the most famous and the most popular.

This website allows users to choose between viewing ads that are 5 seconds, 10 seconds or 20 seconds, with different fees being awarded for each.

Based on the prices offered by Ads4BTC, if you had 20 second ads running for an entire day, you would make less than $10 per day, so this may not be a viable option for most.

Bitcoin Faucets

A Bitcoin faucet is a type of website that gives away small amounts of Bitcoin to its users, with owners making money by placing ads on their website and pay individuals who visit the ads or complete surveys.

This industry amounts of over 50% of the traffic on leading Bitcoin websites today. Faucets let visitors earn a percentage of the Bitcoin that they give away to any visitors that you brought in.

This has resulted in users using a Bitcoin faucet rotator that allows users to quickly surf different faucets and earn a commission through rotation links for each faucet visited by you.

However, similar to PTC websites, Bitcoin faucets are not a realistic way to earn good money, with even the best faucet rotators being applied still only enabling users to make no more than $1-2 per day.

Micro Jobs

Micro jobs are small tasks that can be completed for small amounts of Bitcoin. Websites such as Coinworker offer such tasks, which may involve simply testing a plugin to see if it is successfully compatible with a browser, or just retweeting a post.

Again, the money is small but there is potential to earn a little bit more than the faucets of PTC websites.

Writing about Bitcoin

If you’re knowledgeable about Bitcoin, enthusiastic about the cryptocurrency industry in general and willing and able to share your knowledge, then you can also earn Bitcoin by doing so.

The amount that can be earned by writing about Bitcoin varies, but can be quite lucrative depending on the level of expertise that you have on the subject.

BitcoinTalk Signature Campaigns

The BitcoinTalk Forum Signature campaign pays for users to write posts on the BitcoinTalk forum which includes a product campaign in the signature. Payment levels depend on your membership level on the BitcoinTalk forum, with very little Bitcoin being available for users that aren’t a full member of the forum (to obtain full membership, you need at least 120 posts).

Most campaigns also have certain requirements for posters, such as a minimum word limit or a requirement that no advertisements are directly included in posts. In addition, some campaigns may include a minimum and/or a maximum weekly post count.

The amount of money that can be made from these campaigns varies depending on the number of quality posts that you could make as a user that achieve the word count minimums.

Depending on the campaign you may be able to make $50-100 for 24 hours of work, exclusive of the posts needed to obtain full membership to the forum.

In addition, due to some campaigns operating only allowing for a maximum number of posts per week, there may not be sufficient income within a campaign to earn substantial amounts.

Lots of new Cryptocurrency companies also offer “Bounties” for performing other tasks, such as creating YouTube videos, blogging and posting on social media.

You will earn differing amounts depending on how many followers you have so it can be useful to build your Facebook or Twitter accounts and participate in different campaigns.

You will typically be paid after the ICO has taken place and receive some of the coin or token from the company you helped promote.

Writing for blog and news sites

It is at this point that the potential for making good money begins to rise, although the corresponding requirements for knowledge about Bitcoin also increase at the same time.

There are an ever-increasing number of blogs and news sites that require dedicated writers to discuss Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and, depending on your level of understanding about your subject, there are a virtual limitless number of options available to writers, with good quality writers being paid between $30-100 per 1,000 words.

At this level writers can also choose their payment methods, whether it be in Bitcoin or in fiat currency. Websites such as Coinality is a good place to start if you are looking to find jobs writing about Bitcoin online.

Affiliate Marketing

If you take the writing route for Bitcoin and your blog or website is a success, there is potential to make money through Bitcoin affiliate marketing. This is a form of marketing where you can get paid a certain percentage of commission for every referral that you bring to an existing Bitcoin business.

If the business operates an affiliate programme, and your blog is read by enough people who link to the business and purchase the product offered, then the commissions can potentially be unlimited, for minimal outlay other than the drafting of the original blog post.

Provide Bitcoin-related services

When it comes to cryptocurrency, if your level of expertise is more on the technical side rather than the writing side, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in cryptocurrency development projects.

Most of the companies currently operating in the cryptocurrency industry are start-ups with limited infrastructure in place. Therefore, they often need everything from software developers to web developers to mining experts to online marketers.

Depending on the size of the startup a role such as this can vary from being a contracting job that can be completed remotely, or alternatively could be a full-time job.

The amount that can be earned from a role such as this is obviously dependent on the type of role, the level of expertise that you bring to the role and the number of hours that you will be dedicating to the role.

Bitcoin Mining

Early adherents to the Bitcoin industry have made significant fees through mining Bitcoin. Mining Bitcoin is the process by which new coins are created.

Mining is carried out using certain computer programmes and utilises the processing power of the miner’s computer.

At its inception, Bitcoin mining was relatively simple and the earliest miners were able to mine thousands and thousands of Bitcoin with limited expenditure.

However, at the same time, the value of Bitcoin was nowhere near where it was today and therefore any large profits being made from mining didn’t really begin to happen until a number of years after when the value of Bitcoin began to rise.

Nowadays, Bitcoin mining is much harder. Each Bitcoin that is mined requires more processing power and therefore mining Bitcoin now involves significant processing power and can no longer be done without specialized equipment.

In addition, the costs of the electricity used to power this equipment is phenomenal, with Bitcoin mining currently estimating to be using the same power per day as a country the size of Morocco.

Because of this, most Bitcoin mining has been taken over by companies who can make profit by scale based on buying large amounts of processing hardware at a discount as well as locating themselves in an area with extremely cheap electricity.

For this reason, China is by far the largest Bitcoin mining country (mining over 60% of Bitcoin), followed by Georgia, Sweden and the US.

Bitcoin Trading

There is huge potential to make money on trading in Bitcoin, but it takes a level of expertise and knowledge about the market in the same way that trading on any other financial market does.

In addition, the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile and therefore may not suit everybody’s tastes and risk appetite. The first issue with trading is that almost all of the trading exchanges operate through Bitcoin or Ethereum, meaning that if you wish to trade in cryptocurrency and don’t own any, you will probably need to own some (with some exceptions).

Websites such as Coinbase or CEX both allow users to purchase cryptocurrency by credit or debit card, or alternatively to purchase via a bank transfer. Once purchased, you can then transfer your Bitcoin to whichever exchange you wish to operate on. If you wish to consider trading, here are some of the options:

Day Trading

Day trading is buying and selling Bitcoins on the same day on the basis of small, short-term price fluctuations in the market. Such fluctuations may be based on market trends or simply rumours. Traders can trade Bitcoin against other cryptocurrencies or against fiat currencies such as the US Dollar.

Trading Bots

Running your own Bitcoin Trading bot is an advanced method which can produce good returns if done properly.

We have written a complete guide to trading bots here which will show you the methods and advantages to earning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this way. Here are some of the more popular platforms and bots to use:

3Commas

3Commas is a very popular trading bot which works with a number of exchanges including Bittrex, BitFinex, Binance, Bitstamp, KuCoin, Poloniex, GDAX, Cryptopia, Huobi and YOBIT.

The bot works 24 / / 7 with any device as it is a web-based service so you can monitor your trading dashboard on mobile as well as desktop and laptop computers.

It allows you to set stop-loss and take-profit targets and also has a social trading aspect which allows you to copy the actions of it’s most successful traders.

Cryptohopper

Cryptohopper is a cloud-based trading bot which means it can trade cryptocurrency 24 hours a day whether you are at your computer or not. The system allows you to trade on technical indicators, or subscribe to a signaler who sends buy signals.

According to their website, they “are the first and only automated crypto trading bot to integrate professional external signals.”

CryptoTrader

The CryptoTrader bot is a cloud based trading bot that provides users with fully automated trading solutions while not requiring them to install the bot on their own system.

CryptoTrader features a strategies ‘marketplace’ that allows users to buy their favorite trading strategy, or alternatively to sell strategies developed by themselves.

We have also reviewed CryptoTrader here.

Contracts for Difference

Although similar to day trading, CFDs does not involve actually buying or selling any Bitcoin. Instead, you buy a contract for Bitcoin, meaning that you don’t actually have to hold or store any Bitcoin.

One of the advantages of this is that you can short Bitcoin, meaning that if the price goes down, your profit goes up, allowing you to hedge your trades.

Read: Best Forex Brokers

One of the disadvantages is that you have no control over the Bitcoin you trade with, as you are not the owner of any Bitcoin or the controller of the private key. It can therefore only be used for trading purposes.

More about CFDs here.

Binary Options

Binary options (so-called because the only option is to win or to lose) is a trade strategy that allows you to predict if the price of Bitcoin will rise or fall in a certain period of time.

If the rise or fall occurs within the set period, you will receive the payout agreed upon when entering into the option. If it does not occur, then you lose your investment.

We recently reviewed IQ Option which is the largest site for trading Binary options.

Conclusion

Although not exhaustive, these are some of the most popular ways in which you can earn income online. As noted at the outset, there is no such thing as free Bitcoin and something will have to be given in return, whether it’s time or expertise or both.

However, with an ever-expanding market the demand for Bitcoin expertise and Bitcoin related products means that there has never been a better time to get involved in Bitcoin.","https://blockonomi.com/how-to-make-money-bitcoin/"

Contents [Show]

The platform offers an optimised and intuitive interface for both beginners and seasoned traders.

Bitsgap All-in-one trading platform
What can you do With Bitsgap?

Below we unravel some of the main features available at Bitsgap.

Trading

The trading section of Bitsgap features a sleek interface that is fully functional. In order to make your trading experience as smooth as possible, Bitsgap offers the following abilities and features:

TradingView charts
Over 100 technical indicators
Customizable chart types
Trade visualization through charts

The trading area features an interactive chart screen, including your recent trades and open orders. You can also manage your balance on each of your linked exchanges, track any open positions and view your trade history.

Trading Screen

The interface allows you to easily switch between different exchanges by clicking on the platform name above the chart screen.

Bitsgap has also set up different trading orders to give you more control over your cryptocurrency trading endeavours.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders to limit your losses in the event your trade takes a turn for the worse.
Shadow Order that allows you to trade off the exchange’s order book – with orders executed only when your set price is reached. The order will exist solely through the instructions sent via API but will be hidden from other traders.
Stop Limit Orders are executed at a set price, upon which the order is considered as a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price.
Market Orders lets you execute orders instantly at the best market price available.

In addition, Bitsgap also provides a set of analytical trading tools to research the performance of all popular trading pairs. You can integrate the option of setting a time frame, choosing a chart style and work alongside various indicators.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

The Bitsgap trading bot is a unique feature that lets you make the most of the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace. The bot ensures that your investments are distributed proportionately within your chosen range, so you can make small but frequent profits on every market move. Once the price hits the desired range, orders are executed, and new ones are placed.

The bot will ensure that based on current prices, your buy and sell orders are automatically adjusted to find the best opportunities. The most significant benefit here is that the bot carries out your trades instantaneously.

Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

As such, you stand the chance of benefiting from even the smallest of price movements in the market –  while limiting your losses. Your investments are distributed based on the grid strategy, by dividing your price range into multiple levels or grids.

There are two bot strategies available on the Bitsgap platform. Firstly, the ‘Classic’ bot uses the same amount of the base currency equivalent in each grid. This means that at each level it buys and sells the same quantity of the base currency.

The ‘SBOT’ strategy buys and sells different amounts of the base currency at each grid level. However, it ensures an equal investment distribution as well.

In order to be able to use the trading bot service, you need to have a minimum amount of funds available. This amount is determined by:

The minimum order size of the selected pair in the respective exchange
The number of orders placed by the bot

Once you have connected your exchange API to the Bitsgap trading bot, you can choose the bot to work on the trading strategy of your preference. Bitsgap has already set up several pre-defined strategies proven through backtesting.

If you want to test out a new strategy or make sure that everything runs smoothly, the backtest feature can demonstrate how your bot would respond to market changes.

Since the trading bot can be used in combination with the other features, you will not be choosing between the platform’s two different options. Instead, it will increase your chances of profiting, while making the platform more appealing to users who place multiple trades on a daily basis.

Signals

Signals are how Bitsgap keeps you updated on significant market changes. These will notify you of the price anomalies. If there is any significant movement in the value of a cryptocurrency, you will be alerted. It will help you stay on top of all your trading pairs, and swiftly take action if the market goes in or against your favour.

Signals

Bitsgap has assembled data on the trends of different cryptocurrency trading pairs. If any coin starts to show an irregularity out of the ordinary pattern, it will be entered into the signal list. Furthermore, the platform also uses technical indicators to verify whether a rapid move could be considered a trading signal.

Bitsgap’s trading signals are highly useful to help traders set up the right stop-loss and take-profit orders to curb your risk. You can filter what constitutes a signal for you based on signal strength, raise percentage, exchange and the time.

Crypto Arbitrage

Trading across different exchanges might feel like a complicated task. However, it can be highly beneficial in benefiting from arbitrage opportunities.

For instance, let’s say you are buying a cryptocurrency on one exchange where the price is lower. You stand to gain an advantage by selling the same amount of the same cryptocurrency on another exchange where the price is higher.

Arbitrage opportunities

This is known as crypto arbitrage. Usually, it is a set of cryptocurrency trading orders of the same pair that takes place at the same time, but on two different exchanges. While this may sound almost impossible to do manually, Bitsgap makes it look easy by combining the powers of its automated and AI-powered system.

At Bitsgap, the potential of arbitrage is calculated based on your account balance. You also get to choose between crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat arbitrage opportunities.

Taking into account the different fees and commissions charged by competing exchanges, Bitsgap will include this in its estimated profit percentage. This makes the process more efficient, allowing you to proceed with an arbitrage trade if the numbers stack up.

Bitsgap Portfolio

Another area where Bitsgap shines is in its extensive portfolio management feature. Each time you add the API key of an exchange, the trade portfolios become available at your disposal.

Portfolio management

Your Bitsgap portfolio will:

Automatically update all transactions
Perform tracking based on your trading history
Make it easier to access all your crypto assets
Offer a real-time view of trades, performances and balances.

Above all, what is impressive is that you can extract these portfolios into your system. You can customize and filter the reports to view and reflect on your trades on particular exchanges.

Bitsgap Demo Account

It is important to stress the value of using a demo account when trading. As more new traders are venturing into the cryptocurrency trading scene, this particulate is getting more and more paramount.

The Bitsgap demo facility comes pre-loaded with simulated ‘paper money’ and will allow you to trade with zero financial risk.

Through the Bitsgap demo account, you can:

Gain access to 5 leading crypto exchanges
Practice trading with 5 BTC in virtual funds
Experience trading in live market conditions
Test out trading strategies
Try out signals, trading bots and arbitrage.
How Bitsgap Ensures Security

When trusting any service with your money, you have to be extra cautious in ensuring that your capital is in safe hands. Or not, in the case of Bitsgap.

The platform stresses that you and only you have access to your funds. Bitsgap has detailed out how it addresses security concerns in different areas.

Account Access

All login attempts are secured, and in case of an attempt from an unknown device or location, you will instantly receive an email. The system will also authorize a temporary lockout from both your API and account if there are repeated failed login attempts.

Furthermore, you are also encouraged to use 2FA for your Bitsgap account and your associated email ID. This will provide an additional layer of security on your funds and personal data.

Bitsgap Security
API Keys

Your funds are secured in the respective exchange and connected only through your fully-encrypted API keys. These APIs allow Bitsgap to execute trades and gather information on your behalf. Other than that, the API does not yield any personal data.

All forms of information that is passed through are encrypted and protected by a firewall. In simple terms, this means that Bitsgap cannot view or extract sensitive information held by the exchange in question.

You are the one to decide the settings of your API key. If you have enabled withdrawal options, your API key will not be accepted. Your exchange wallet will hold the funds, and you cannot perform any withdrawals or deposits through Bitsgap.

Employee Security

Employees are given access only to their area of expertise. No account information and sensitive data is transmitted outside the company network, or to any third parties.

System and Server

Bitsgap uses RSA 2048 encryption on all its services. Generally, the majority of banks and other financial establishments use 1024-bit encryption, whereas Bitsgap emphasizes that they offer double the protection.

Bitsgap Pricing

Thinking of using Bitsgap? If so, you’ll have several plans to choose from – both free and paid-for.

Bitsgap Pricing
Free Plan at $0

The free plan is, in fact, a trial plan available for usage for 14 days. All standard features are included in this plan, along with a $1,000 monthly trading limit. We highly recommend that you take advantage of this free trial to understand how the platform works before you opt-in for a paid version.

Basic Plan at $19 a Month

The basic account comes with all standard features and allows you to engage in unlimited exchanges. However, there is a trading limit of $25,000.

You also get access to your cross-exchange portfolio, and can set up trading signals and extended order types. The demo trading option is also available together with two active automated trading bots.

Advanced Plan at $44 a Month

This account gives you all perks of the basic plan, with a $100,000 monthly trading limit. There is also a boost in the number of active trading bots from 2 to 5. In addition, you can also benefit from the Bitsgap arbitrage services.

Pro Plan at $110 a Month

The Pro Plan is most suited for traders who are looking for unlimited limits across unlimited exchanges. You can also set up 15 active bots to trade in live market conditions. Pro Plan owners will also receive priority support.

Note: Bistgap does not charge any fees for any trades. All of its services are included in the monthly subscription fee. Any fees on transactions are imposed by the respective exchange you are trading on.

How to Start Using Bitsgap

Your trading journey at Bitsgap begins with three simple steps.

Create your user account
Connect your exchange APIs.
Start trading

The registration process can be completed by entering your email ID and setting your password. You will only be required to confirm your email ID to finish the setup.

Additionally, you can also connect your account to Google or Facebook and gain access through your login credentials accounts of the respective platform.

The APIs can be obtained from your exchange accounts. All trading operations on Bitsgap is processed through your unique API key. It is one of the safest and most reliable ways to use any platform, as it does not authorize anyone else to gain access to your funds or data.

Is Bitsgap Worth Using?

It is worth noticing that Bitsgap has come a long way since its launch. The platform’s number one priority is to ensure that its features are up-to-date with industry standards, if not one step ahead.

Its API feature was taken to bridge the technological gap between exchanges, as well as increase efficiency and security. Where it lacks is in its resource department.

Though there is a dedicated Knowledge Base, it still fails to provide a comprehensive overview of how to use the software. That said, if you genuinely want to try the platform, then the free trial should give you a better understanding of how its features work.

You will need to have accounts set up at each exchange separately, meaning you will need to deposit funds into each platform. Bitsgap is not licensed by any regulatory bodies, so do bear this in mind.

However, there are some areas where Bitsgap truly shines.

Easy setup and integration with exchanges
Fully-automated trading bots
Secure trading with 2048-bit encryption
Extensive portfolio management
Receive trading insights
Availability of pre-defined market strategies
A long list of supported currencies and exchanges

Given that Bitsgap is aiming to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible, it would also be great to have a mobile app to access all services on the go.

Bitsgap: Verdict?

Cryptocurrency trading is now mainstream, meaning that there is a growing demand for technically-adept trading services. If you are looking for a combination of advanced trading tools, technical indicators and ease of use, Bitsgap is worth considering.

Overall, Bitsgap is a safe, secure and fully encrypted platform to trade with. The automated trading algorithm is clearly a standout benefit, which allows you to generate a steady flow of revenue with very little risk.

The platform also gives you several ways to control your trades through a variety of market orders and exit strategies.

Considering how far the platform has come, it is only fair to expect Bitsgap to introduce more resources in the future. All in all, you have very little to risk by trying the platform out via its 14-day free trial.

How to Get Started on 3Commas

Creating an account is a straight forward process, and the main page has a green “Create an Account” tab at the top of the page.

1) Create an Account

Visit the 3Commas website and enter an email address and password in order to register. After confirming your account via clicking the link in the email sent, you will gain access to the dashboard.

2) Choose the bot type

There are four types of trading bots, short, simple, composite, and composite short bots, and a simple trading bot only involves one trading pair and is the most straight forward to set up.

3) Connect an exchange

The simple trading bot feature only works with Binance exchange when you start out, and you can connect a Binance account here.  Make sure your account is connected via API and holds BNB and has BNB fee payment feature turned on. After this, you can move on to naming your bot.

4) Choose trading pair and set base trade size

You can select the trading pair you want your bot to trade from the drop-down menu, and you can then tell your bot just how much of your preferred currency you will be use during your initial trade.

5) Set target profit

Before doing this, it’s a good idea to set a safety trade size, as you can make purchases after any dips in a more controlled way. If a trading pair of ETH/BTC is chosen, and if after buying ETH the price drops below the original purchase price, then safety trades allow you to buy more ETH with the amount of BTC that set in the safety trade size.

Afterwards, you can set that target profit which informs the trading bot when to sell according to percentages. If a target profit is set for 3%, then the trading bot will automatically execute a sell order once this profit has been realised.

6) Choose take profit type

There are two take profit options, which are a percentage from base trade or a percentage from the total volume.

7) Set max safety trades count

This informs the trading bot how many safety trades it can make before stopping, and the max active safety trades count tells the trading bot the quantity of active safety trades it can conduct at any given time.

8) Set price deviation to open safety trades

This tells the trading bot when it can begin executing safety trades, and is set as a percentage. If set to 3, when the price of the chosen currency drops by 3% below the initial trade price, then the trading bot will start to execute safety trades.

9) Set trade start conditions

This informs the bot of when to make the initial trade, and there is a choice of TradingView Signal Buy or Strong Buy, TradingView Signal Strong Buy, Manually, or Open New Trade ASAP.

By following these steps, a trading bot can be configured in just a few minutes, and the entire process is simple enough for more novice traders to follow successfully. The platform is still detailed enough to also attract more experienced traders.

How to Profit from Using the Automated Bots

After a bot is set up, users can begin to carry out long and short trades, for short trades, a price rise in the currency selected will result in the execution of the sale of the underlying cryptocurrency once the designated profit level is reached. In the event of a price reversal safety orders can be placed to ensure that the bot also makes purchases at a given percentage increase.

The 3Commas team have outlined both long and short algorithms that enable the contrary strategies of selling higher and buying lower to be used to generate profits.

Long – buy lower, sell higher

The bot opens a new deal according to one of the conditions that are available for selection during the creation. After that, it immediately puts a coin for sale. If the price rises and the order gets filled, the profit goal is achieved. In case of a price fall, the bot places safety orders below the purchase price every x%. Every filled safety order is averaging the buy price, and it makes possible to move the TakeProfit target lower and close the deal without losing profits on the first price bounce. Buy one coin at $10 then sell it at $11. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you get more after the sell. $11 got against $10 spent.

Simplified algorithm:

Buy initial part of coins.
Place a sell order.
Place safety buy orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update sell order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the sell if finished.
Short – sell higher, buy lower

It’s a reversed version of “Long” algorithm. Sell one coin at $10 then repurchase it at $9. It makes a profit from the difference in prices as you spend less to repurchase. $9 spent against $10 got.

Simplified algorithm:

Sell initial part of coins.
Place a buy order.
Place safety sell orders.
In case of safety orders get filled update buy order.
Cancel safety orders and calculate profits after the buy if finished.
How Smart Trading Works

3Commas incorporates a Smart Trading feature that uses TakeProfit and StopLoss commands to help users maximize their trading profits. Traders can customize their portfolios with commands to buy or sell at a given price point. The commands work as follows:

Trailing Take Profit – The Trailing Take Profit feature has been designed to help traders realise the most gains. If a user purchases multiples of ETH at $500 each and sets a standard take profit order at $550, then they would make a profit of $50 per ETH.

However, if the price of ETH continues to rise above $550 then the Trailing Take Profit allows you to sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. As a result, if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH hits $600 before falling, then the sell order is activated when the price falls by 10%, or below $540.

Trailing Stop Loss – This works in the same way as a standard Stop Loss order as they both allow you to minimize your exposure to losses when prices decline. A Trailing Stop Loss order differs slightly as it is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations, whereas a Stop Loss order is set manually at a fixed price threshold.

As a result, if multiples of ETH are purchased at $500, with a Stop Loss order set at 10%, the stop loss order will execute automatically, if the price of ETH falls below $450, and sell your ETH at that price. If the price of ETH increases over the day, a Trailing Stop Loss order automatically adjusts to the price change, and if ETH increases in price by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order triggers when the adjusted price drops by 10%, resulting in a 5% gain. This differs from a standard Stop Loss order which will only execute when the price falls below 10% of the original buy-in price.

How safe is 3Commas?

The team don’t go into too many details regarding the security protocols that they choose to employ, however, it’s worth remembering that you don’t actually hold any funds on the platform and your trading bots are not able to make withdrawals from your linked accounts.

Similar to other trading bot platforms, your trading bots connect with your exchange accounts via API and then proceed to carry out automated trades on your linked exchanges. While this process takes place, users aren’t required to make any cash/crypto transfers to external accounts and simply need to provide their API keys which are generated by their exchanges.

These keys provide the trading bots with restricted access to user accounts strictly to conducts trades, and do not grant the bots with any withdrawal rights.

This also means that if your account becomes compromised, and nefarious actors were able to gain control of your trading activity, they still wouldn’t be able to directly access your exchange accounts in order to make withdrawals.

However, the standard personal security rules of crypto still apply, as they could still have a detrimental effect on the funds held in your exchange accounts. Hackers have been known to obtain API access to exchange accounts, and commander the bots to purchase high quantities of low value coins that the hacker’s have already previously purchased.

After artificially inflating both the demand and price of said coins, the hackers then sell off their personal holdings for a profit, leaving the compromised account owners holding funds in the low value coins.

As a result, in order to mitigate these risks, users are advised to enable the available security options such as two factor authentication (2FA) and notification alerts. Notifications can be enabled which alert users of every log in on their account, and the platform also makes use of new IP detection, with verification emails being sent out when a user logs in from a new destination.

In order to gain access to their account, the user will be required to enter a one off code number or click the link provided in the verification email.

The 3Commas team do state that they are committed to data security and the protection of their users’ personal data and all data is protected by security integrated safeguards. These vary in approach and include the use of secure areas, and technical measures such as encryption and secure servers.

The team also outline that in the event of a security breach, they would implement their Incident and Breach Response Plan, which includes sending notifications to individuals as soon as possible.
